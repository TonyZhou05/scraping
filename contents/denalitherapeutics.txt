Skip to main content De-risking Discovery & Development in Neurodegeneration In building and developing our portfolio, we are guided by three overarching principles. The therapeutic target or pathway for each program is genetically linked to neurodegenerative disease. Our product candidates are engineered to optimize brain delivery. The clinical development plan is enabled by biomarkers. We rigorously follow the science and employ the therapeutic modality that we believe is best suited to modulate the target pathway.

ACCEPT NO THANKSSkip to main content SCIENCE Genetic Pathway Potential Advances in the genetics, pathology and cell biology underlying chronic neurodegenerative disease have identified pathways that trigger neurodegeneration and contribute to disease onset and progression. Denali is applying deep scientific and drug development expertise to fully harvest the potential of these pathways and discover effective molecular therapeutics. Each program is addressing a target or pathway that is genetically validated to cause or increase the risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Degenogenes Rapid progress in identifying human genetic risk associated with neurodegenerative disease has revealed numerous genes involved in neurodegeneration. Degenogenes are genes that when mutated cause, or are major risk factors for, neurodegenerative disease. These degenogenes highlight important disease pathways for therapeutic discovery, including lysosomal function, glial biology and cellular homeostasis.

Dysfunction of the lysosomal system is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and neurodegeneration in the context of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs. Therapeutics designed to correct lysosomal dysfunction are a promising approach to treat neurodegeneration.

These cells serve various functions in the brain, including supporting neuronal health, pruning neuronal synapses, and providing immune surveillance and response. Genetic and pathological data suggest that glial dysfunction significantly contributes to neurodegenerative disease. Correcting glial dysfunction represents an attractive therapeutic strategy.

Specifically, defects in protein, RNA or metabolic homeostasis leads to the death of neurons and dysfunction of the nervous system. This includes spreading of protein aggregates resulting in proteinopathy in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and the aggregation of RNA binding proteins disrupting cellular stress response in ALS and Alzheimer’s disease. Therapies that correct defects in cellular homeostasis have the potential to halt neurodegeneration.

These blood vessels are lined by closely linked endothelial cells to form the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which protects the brain from toxins by regulating the transfer of proteins, nutrients and waste products. Delivering therapeutics across the BBB has been a major obstacle to successful drug development in neurodegeneration, and is critical to enabling effective treatments. Small Molecules ENGINEERING AND DESIGN Delivery of small molecule therapeutics to the brain has been challenging as most small molecule drugs are actively excluded by efflux pumps. It has been estimated that approximately 98% of small molecule drugs do not cross the BBB. We are focused on engineering small molecule therapeutics that achieve exposure levels in the brain sufficient to bind to protein targets and drive a therapeutic effect. Efficacious orally administered small-molecule medicines for brain diseases must be readily absorbed from the gut into the blood and penetrate the BBB while avoiding transporter-mediated efflux.

For example, the concentration of most therapeutic antibodies in the brain is only 0.1% of the concentration in the blood. We are developing proprietary platform technologies to actively transport these molecules across the BBB through receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). RMT through the BBB is the process by which macromolecules in the blood bind to receptors on the endothelial cells that make up the BBB and are actively transported and released into the brain. Our large molecule transport vehicle (TV), platform technology engineers BBB receptor binding into an Fc domain. We have selected transferrin receptor (TfR), which is a highly-expressed BBB receptor that we believe has the ability to substantially improve brain uptake of therapeutic molecules. This construct can be integrated and fused to therapeutic molecules as described below, without disrupting the binding of transferrin to TfR.

ACCEPT NO THANKSSkip to main content SCIENCE Biomarker-Driven Development The development path of each program is enabled by biomarkers to monitor early effects of the drug and select the right patients and the right dose in clinical development. Target Engagement In the design of our Phase 1 trials, we integrate our target engagement biomarker data with pharmacokinetic analysis from both plasma and CSF to determine the relationship between dose, time, drug exposure and drug response. We develop integrated exposure response models that enable quantitative dose selection for future patient studies. Pathway Engagement In building deep expertise in the biologic understanding of degenogenes, we can identify and use pathway biomarkers to monitor effects on target biology that may be relevant to human disease outcomes. Demonstration of pathway engagement further de-risks our targets by establishing an effect on the relevant biology. Patient Phenotyping Patient phenotyping is the intersection of Pathway Biology and Disease Pathology. In building deep expertise in both disease biology and the pathway biology of degenogenes, we enable a patient selection strategy that can better target and select the best patient population for our clinical trials and product candidates. Product Candidate Biomarkers As part of our strategy, we are developing proprietary reagents and assays to enable biomarkers for each of our core programs. These biomarkers, which are relevant for both animal models and human trials, are critical for patient selection, predicting and measuring target engagement, supporting dose selection and enabling decisions on progression of product candidates to the next phase of development.
