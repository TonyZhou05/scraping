Our teams of scientists use novel approaches to help deliver therapies and solutions for conditions with the greatest unmet need.  Through patient-focused drug development, we empower patient voices to be heard and help guide our decision-making process to advance cutting-edge science. KEY AREAS OF FOCUS How we innovate for patients: Partnering to advance drug development We partner with patients, patient organizations, caregivers and clinicians to ensure that individual experiences, perspectives, needs and priorities are part of the clinical development process. For example, our approach to Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) is grounded in collaborations with key stakeholders to understand patients' lived experiences, allowing us to develop strategies and solutions to help patients thrive. Diversifying our clinical trials We believe clinical trials should reflect the populations we serve. Led by our dedicated Clinical Trial Diversity & Inclusion team, we work to design inclusive study protocols, enable under-represented populations to volunteer and continuously evaluate our clinical trial eligibility criteria against real-world datasets — so that all patients can have their voices heard. To learn more, read about our commitment to racial justice. Embedding the patient experience We work to better understand the experience of people living with a disease or condition, integrating their perspectives throughout our clinical development process to meet their specialized health needs. We develop robust patient journey maps to understand the transactional and emotional journey people experience from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. Advancing digital health technologies From wearables to gaming platforms that measure disease symptoms and treatment outcomes, we're deploying digital health technology (DHT) tools that enable unprecedented data gathering and insights that inform our drug development process.  For diseases that are challenging to develop new therapies, our new tools help enable the development of objective and sensitive digital biomarkers — which aim to improve our ability to identify treatment responders faster and make clinical assessments more precise.  We also measure some outcomes in the real-world setting through connected sensor technology alongside COAs to provide a holistic understanding of patient experience. For example, we measure improvements in physical activity, sleep, and joint range of motion upon treatment in rheumatic conditions. In dermatological indications, images can be captured and assessed in real-time, enabling evidence-based treatment discussions based on disease activity. Unlocking the potential of Real-World Evidence (RWE) RWE is clinical data derived from real patients during their real lives, which has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how a new therapeutic option will work by complementing the findings of traditional randomized clinical trials.  RWE helps us understand disease burden, treatment patterns, patient behaviors and unmet needs, and treatment performance — particularly populations with disparities in care and outcomes — that cannot be studied through traditional clinical trials.

About clinical trials A critical component of developing medicines is clinical research. This involves conducting clinical trials in humans to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational medications. Sometimes these studies include healthy volunteers but most of the studies are conducted in patients with the diseases we are studying.  Local authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as those in many other countries, use the data gathered in these trials to determine whether or not to approve the medication for use in their countries. To ensure these studies are conducted to the highest standards of protection for individuals who participate in the studies, AbbVie strictly follows important rules governing clinical research. These include the World Medical Association’s (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and all applicable local rules and regulatory requirements.

About Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the large intestine that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending, to a variable extent, from the rectum to the more proximal colon.1,2 The hallmark signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus (a sense of pressure), urgency and fecal incontinence.1,3 The disease course of ulcerative colitis varies between patients and can range from quiescent disease to chronic refractory disease, which in some cases can lead to surgery or complications, including cancer or death.2,4 The severity of symptoms and unpredictability of disease course can lead to substantial burden and often disability among those living with the disease.5 About Crohn's Disease Crohn's disease is a chronic, systemic disease that manifests as inflammation within the gastrointestinal (or digestive) tract, causing persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.2,6,7 It is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time.2,7 Because the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease are unpredictable, it causes a significant burden on people living with the disease—not only physically, but also emotionally and economically.5 About RINVOQ® (upadacitinib) Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Based on enzymatic and cellular assays, RINVOQ demonstrated greater inhibitory potency for JAK-1 vs JAK-2, JAK-3, and TYK-2.8 The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness and safety is not currently known. In the U.S., RINVOQ 15 mg is approved for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers; adults with active psoriatic arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers; adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF blocker therapy.8 RINVOQ 45 mg is approved for use in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers as an induction therapy once daily for 8 weeks. The recommended dose of RINVOQ for maintenance treatment is 15 mg once daily. A dosage of 30 mg once daily may be considered for patients with refractory, severe or extensive disease. Discontinue RINVOQ if an adequate response is not achieved with the 30 mg dose. Use the lowest effective dosage needed to maintain response. RINVOQ 15 mg once daily can also be initiated in adults and children 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg with refractory, moderate to severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. In these children and adults less than 65 years of age who do not achieve an adequate response, the dose may be increased to 30 mg once daily. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.9-16 US Indications and Important Safety Information about RINVOQ® (upadacitinib)8 USES RINVOQ is a prescription medicine used to treat: Adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when 1 or more medicines called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers have been used, and did not work well or could not be tolerated. Adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) when 1 or more medicines called TNF blockers have been used, and did not work well or could not be tolerated. Adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) when 1 or more medicines called TNF blockers have been used, and did not work well or could not be tolerated. Adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) when 1 or more medicines called TNF blockers have been used, and did not work well or could not be tolerated. Adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation when a TNF blocker medicine has been used, and did not work well or could not be tolerated. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Adults and children 12 years of age and older with moderate to severe eczema (atopic dermatitis [AD]) that did not respond to previous treatment and their eczema is not well controlled with other pills or injections, including biologic medicines, or the use of other pills or injections is not recommended. RINVOQ is safe and effective in children 12 years of age and older weighing at least 88 pounds (40 kg) with atopic dermatitis. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children under 12 years of age with atopic dermatitis.
