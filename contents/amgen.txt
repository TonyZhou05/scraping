To accomplish this mission, we need to take full advantage of opportunities arising from rapid scientific progress and new technologies. Biotechnology and the data sciences are advancing at blinding speed, opening up immense new possibilities. At the same time, competition within the industry is intensifying, and there are more and steeper barriers to medical access. To keep pace with these rapidly changing opportunities and challenges, Amgen has adopted a dynamic R&D strategy. It is designed to: Focus on large effect sizes in serious illnesses with unmet need. Look to the biology first to understand disease and design new potential therapies. Bring together our leading internal innovation with world-class external innovation. With the union of technology and biotechnology, we are at a hinge moment in drug discovery and development. Amgen's scientific success is rooted in unique capabilities that include: Human data: To advance precision medicine and better understand human diversity and disease using genomics, omics and other data. Multispecifics and other modalities: To drug the undruggable by engaging one or more targets at once. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science: To design better biologics more quickly and effectively. Clinical trial innovation: To speed up and improve trials using the latest technologies. By building on Amgen's long-standing strengths in science and biotechnology, and with the addition of the latest in technology, we have a clear purpose: For every patient – a solution. — David M. Reese, Executive Vice President, Research and Development Read the 2022 R&D Annual Review     DOWNLOAD REPORT    OUR SCIENCE Human Data Insights from human data will help us improve understanding of disease prediction, identify new targets as well as finding the right patient populations for the next generation of first-in class therapeutics. AI and Data Science Investing in the power of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and other technologies to create the next generation of medicines that will bring the most value to patients. Multispecifics & Other Modalities Multispecific medicines have the potential to radically alter our concept of how drugs work and pave the way for new therapies. Clinical Trial Innovation We are innovating clinical trials in ways that are improving our understanding of the natural course of disease as well as our ability to predict patient responses to the new medicines in development. Our Vision A world where science defeats all disease. Our Priorities Improve our success rates. Focus our people and investments more intensely on the most promising technologies and activities most likely to lead to new therapies. Reduce cycle times. The industry's standard timeline of 12 to 14 years from project start to drug approval is not viable. Amgen has already reduced its drug development timelines, but there is still ample room for improvements. Broaden access and use. Gaining regulatory approval for new therapies is only half the battle. In the end, only one metric matters: Are the patients who need Amgen medicines actually getting them? Our Strategic Imperatives Make focused investment in innovative research platforms Focus research investments in cardiovascular and metabolic, inflammation and cancer therapeutic areas. Rapidly expand the scale and diversity of our human omics platforms to move towards a precision medicine approach to drug discovery and development. Expand our human data resources to include proteomics, transcriptomics and clinical/real world data. This will generate deeper insights into disease biology, find new drug targets and speed up clinical trials. Use our molecular engineering strength combined with the power of AI/machine learning to expand on the success of current drug platforms, including multispecifics such as BiTE® molecules, and pioneer novel modalities to address targets now seen as undruggable. Innovate in Clinical Development Increase the speed and efficiency of clinical trials and improve success rates through greater use of modelling and simulation, adaptive designs and real-world evidence. Increase recruitment of patients who will potentially benefit most from new therapies, design smaller and faster studies with larger response rates by using human data, including genetics and omics. Address access and use at all stages of drug development Engage with healthcare professionals, regulators and payors to enable broader and faster access to therapies. Accelerate bringing molecules from the lab, through the clinic, to approval and to patients around the world because of the immense interconnected R&D ecosystem so the patients who need our medicines most are getting them as fast as possible. Support our people Our past and future success relies on our people – they form the foundation for all that we do. We will continue to build an R&D culture that supports, develops and nurtures a diverse talent base energized by the rapid scientific progress and new technology we are using to push the boundaries of science. Our teams are vested in a collective accountability for our success. Stay Connected With Amgen. Contact Us Sitemap Privacy Statement Your Cookie Preferences Terms of Use © 1996-2023 Amgen Inc.

Long, because it takes years to complete all the laboratory, animal and human tests; careful, because all those involved in bringing it to market must ensure patient safety and follow strict government regulations in evaluating the drug's safety and efficacy. One of the most important steps in the development process is the clinical trial, which is a study with people who volunteer to receive the drug and be observed for its effects. It is through these trials that investigational drugs are tested to determine whether they can benefit human beings. But before this can happen, people must volunteer and participate - a choice that may benefit not only the individual but many, many others as well. Whether or not you qualify for a clinical trial depends on a number of factors, including your medical condition. Your physician will discuss these factors with you and provide comprehensive information on the investigational drug and the trial itself. Still, you may have questions. Participation in a clinical trial can be a great undertaking, and there are no guarantees that the investigational drug will work. This page, however, will help you understand some of the potential benefits and risks of participation, and give you some idea of what to expect if you decide to participate.

Equitable access to clinical trials is integral to achieving health equity. Amgen is dedicated to the development of new drugs based on clinical trials, conducted without bias, and with representation of all patients who are afflicted with the disease we are seeking to treat. In November 2020, Amgen, along with other members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), launched industry-wide principles on clinical trial diversity with the goal of addressing the systemic issues that deter people of different races, sexes/genders, socioeconomic circumstances, and other system-level, individual-level, and interpersonal-level barriers from participating in clinical trials. Read more about these principles here. Achieving diversity and representation in clinical trials is critical work that is the responsibility of all of us at Amgen. A dedicated team, RISE, was launched in 2020 to drive the change and keep progress moving at a steady pace. The extraordinary response from colleagues across the company demonstrates the urgency and our shared commitment to addressing the issue head-on. We all know it's the right one. Why diversity in clinical trials matters Volunteer participants make a vital contribution to research and generate valuable information. When some groups are underrepresented there is a risk of collecting insufficient data to assess effectiveness or safety in those populations. Racial and/or ethnic background in combination with other interdependent factors can contribute to differences in drug exposure or response. Equitable access to clinical trials is integral to achieving health equity.   RISE (Representation in Clinical Research) is an Amgen program dedicated to improving the diversity and representation of participants in the company's clinical trials.   Our Work Amgen is driven by six pillars Evolve the way we design and run clinical trials, focusing on people who have been historically excluded from clinical research. Partner with clinical trial investigators who are representative of the participants they are aiming to recruit. Bring the research directly to the communities where people live and work. Change how researchers communicate with patients, caregivers, and providers. Enhance precision medicine awareness and improve genetic diversity in translational science. Collaborate with national and community organizations. Clinical trials have lacked diversity for decades Nearly 40% of Americans belong to a racial or ethnic minority, but individuals who participate in clinical trials for new drugs skew heavily White—in some cases, 80 to 90%. Black/African Americans make up over 13% of the U.S. population, but only 7% of clinical trial participants.1,2 Hispanics/Latinos represent over 18% of the U.S. population, but only 11% of clinical trial participants.1,3 Asian Americans make up 6% of the U.S. population, but make up 1.7% of participants for drugs for which at least 70% of trials were conducted in the U.S.4     RESPONSIBILITY | 02.05.2021 | Inside Amgen's Push for Greater Diversity in Clinical Trials Through an internal program known as RISE (Representation in Clinical Research), Amgen is looking to create greater equity related to clinical trial diversity.

Innovation in Action Amgen is a global leader in biologics manufacturing — including pioneering processes such as an innovative single-use technology that reduces the need to clean and sterilize equipment thereby reducing the high-energy and water-consumptions costs of traditional manufacturing. Amgen’s Innovation: Efficiency Through Continuous Improvement Manufacturing biologics, medicines produced by living cells,1 is complicated, intricate and resource-intense.2 Biologics have changed the face of medicine1 and will continue to do so;3 however, it is clear that manufacturers need to ensure their processes are as flexible and efficient as possible to deliver a cost-effective and reliably available product.4 As a global leader in biologics manufacturing, Amgen evaluates all options to make its medicines with the highest quality manufacturing processes and continually evaluates those processes to find efficiencies in obvious and not so obvious ways. For example, Amgen has pioneered the combined use of new, single-use technologies with traditional stainless equipment to reduce the sole reliance on expensive and inefficient apparatus. By using disposable equipment such as filters, tank liners and even bioreactors themselves, processes are more efficient and less prone to contamination.4 Single-use technology reduces the need to clean and sterilize equipment after use, thereby minimizing water consumption and consequent impact on the environment.5 Importantly, these processes reduce the high energy required to sterilize large manufacturing equipment.4 Change-over times are shorter and this reduces production timelines with a resulting boost to productivity and ability to respond to demand. Single-use equipment is also designed to be more simple to operate and install, thereby reducing the potential risk of human error.4 This results in a more efficient, streamlined manufacturing process.4,6 Amgen scientists are transforming the biopharmaceutical landscape through combining innovative, single-use technologies, thereby improving productivity and efficiency in manufacturing biologics. This is achieved through stream-lining processes, reducing chances of contamination, and saving energy as repeated sterilization of older and more complicated equipment is no longer required. The combined use of disposable technologies will continue to shape the future of biopharmaceutical manufacturing. References Sekhon BS, Saluja V, Biosimilars 2011.

Quality in Action Quality by Design (QbD) is a set of principles adopted by Amgen to ensure quality control in the manufacturing process. It's part of a regimen of important processes Amgen has developed to produce and deliver high-quality products that are both safe and compliant with regulatory requirements.  Delivering High-Quality Products Through Quality Processes Amgen, either independently or in collaboration with industry peers, has developed important processes for producing high-quality products in compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, Amgen has adopted the Quality by Design (QbD) principles, which further integrate quality control into the manufacturing process.1 For QbD, the product and process knowledge base must include an understanding of variability in raw materials, the relationship between a process and product’s critical quality attributes (CQAs), and the association between CQAs and a product’s clinical properties. Successful implementation of QbD concepts requires cooperation across a multitude of company teams, from R&D to manufacturing to quality control and regulatory affairs.2 By utilizing QbD principles and adhering to regulatory requirements, Amgen follows a systematic approach to the development of its medicines that begins with predefined objectives and emphasizes extensive product knowledge, process understanding and process control, based on sound science and quality risk management.1 Knowledge and experience gained from previous biologic medicine development is utilized to create a list of CQAs. Potential impacts on CQAs comprise many elements, including formulation components (excipients, buffer components, surfactant, raw materials impurities, and protein concentrations), solution conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength), process conditions (freeze/thaw, transportation, photo exposure, mixing, hold time, ultrafiltration/diafiltration, filtration, filling, lyophilization, inspection), and components (IV bags, tubings, vials, syringes, stoppers, devices) is created and the effects of these parameters on CQAs are then studied. This knowledge and expertise allows Amgen to identify and understand quality variability during process development so they can be measured and controlled in real-time during manufacturing.1 Understanding the impact of attributes of aggregates/particulates in monoclonal antibody-based formulations on potential biomarkers of the innate and adaptive immune responses are important predictors of the potential immunogenicity of aggregates/particles in biotherapeutics.3 Given the association between protein aggregation (intrinsic to manufacturing and storage of biotherapeutics) and the increased risk of immunogenicity, Amgen scientists established a series of quality target profiles and continue to investigate the process inputs most likely to impact these attributes.

Shortages of prescription medicines are a growing problem around the world. Drug shortages can have a significant impact on patients and healthcare providers. As identified by the FDA, quality, manufacturing, and capacity issues are major reasons for many of these drug shortages. We are deeply committed to ensuring doctors and patients can rely on the quality and availability of our treatments, including the biosimilars we plan to manufacture. The Amgen approach to providing a continuous supply of biologic therapies has four key elements:  PREVENTION, which includes ensuring exemplary regulatory compliance, robust quality management processes, operational excellence, supply chain security, infrastructure investments, and business continuity planning TECHNOLOGY to enhance product purity and the robustness of the manufacturing process INVENTORY MANAGEMENT to ensure we have the right quantities of the product housed in diverse geographic locations REDUNDANT MANUFACTURING capacity in multiple geographic locations and back-up suppliers for raw materials We've taken steps to understand potential vulnerabilities in processes and facilities and made significant investments to help ensure the quality and supply of Amgen biotech products.3 Reliability in Action Drug shortages are a growing global concern. Beyond compliance with current good manufacturing practices and a robust quality management system, Amgen takes extra steps to help ensure a reliable supply of medicine to every patient, every time.  Mitigating Risk in Supply in an Era of Drug Shortages As drug shortages become a growing global concern,1 leading manufacturers of biologics, such as Amgen, have identified key practices to help mitigate risk in supply to patients. Causes of drug shortages can include manufacturing difficulties, product quality issues, manufacturing delays, unexpected increased product demand, product discontinuations and recalls, and raw material sourcing issues.1 Amgen has developed a multifaceted approach to help prevent drug shortages and employ risk management tactics that involve a continuous process of identifying, preventing, and responding to risks holistically.2 Beyond compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and a robust quality management system, Amgen takes extra steps to help ensure a reliable supply to every patient, every time. As a first step, Amgen invests in inventory management at multiple points in the supply chain to mitigate potential risks of disruptions to supply (e.g., natural disasters). Additionally, Amgen maintains appropriate levels of raw materials by diversifying suppliers of sourced raw materials and storing high-risk raw materials in multiple geographical locations to safeguard their availability. By managing relationships with suppliers to ensure that raw materials requirements are understood and shared between both parties, Amgen is able to assure high-quality raw materials to minimize reprocessing and potential product manufacturing issues, and help ensure consistent product quality.2 Maintaining diverse manufacturing capabilities requires significant investment in internal manufacturing and contract manufacturing capabilities.2 By maintaining eight manufacturing plants around the globe, Amgen is able to execute plans to implement back-up manufacturing capabilities (diversification), as well as enhance existing contract manufacturing capabilities.3 Amgen is also able to ensure the active management of robust and secure distribution networks, by establishing well-controlled temperature (“cold chain”) distribution channels to maintain quality of each product and utilizing multiple approaches to mitigate distribution-related security risks to supply. These include controlled shipping lanes using temperature-validated shipping containers to maintain chain of custody, anti-theft and anti-counterfeiting measures to mitigate the risk of diversion and adulteration, and risk management programs to systematically address risks as they develop.2 Amgen implements product security programs to help ensure reliable supply of its medicines to patients2   References Woodcock J, Wosinska M.

Not all adverse events associated with the use of a medicinal product are observed in clinical trials. It is therefore important for us to continue to collect adverse events associated with the use of our products even when the product has been approved for use on the market. Once the product receives marketing approval from health authorities, safety data collection continues through multiple channels: additional clinical studies, reports by patients and health care professionals, registries, scientific literature, and external database reviews. Individual adverse event reports are continuously added to our safety database, and they help contribute to the overall understanding of the safety profile of our products. Click on Adverse Event and Product Complaint Reporting to see how you can report an Adverse Event to Amgen. Safety Governance Framework for Risk Assessment and Evaluation Global Patient Safety utilizes a decision-making framework to identify, communicate, and mitigate product safety risks.  Amgen’s safety governance framework is comprised of cross-functional governance teams which bring together individuals with pharmacovigilance, medical, regulatory and other relevant expertise. By working in teams, we are able to achieve quality results, leveraging expertise from internal and external collaborators as needed to analyze potential safety signals.  These teams are responsible for characterizing the safety profile for all products in development and post approval. Amgen continuously monitors safety information from different sources in order to identify safety signals that could potentially suggest new adverse events might be linked to or associated with the use of our products.  Risk evaluation or signal detection can take the form of qualitative review of individual cases and/or use of quantitative methods to assist with the review of aggregate data. Appropriate statistical methods and data mining techniques are applied to databases with a large volume of safety data to better detect signals in a timely manner. In addition, product quality monitoring, in the context of adverse events, is also employed in order to detect safety signals related to the complex manufacturing processes of our biological medicines. Signal detection activities for an Amgen product initiate as soon as the first subject begins to receive an investigational medicinal product in a clinical trial, and continue throughout the product lifecycle. The strategy of signal detection for each Amgen product is individually tailored depending on its stage of the product lifecycle. Signals identified through review of safety data undergo further assessment and are evaluated to determine whether new safety information constitutes a risk to patients. If a safety risk is identified, our experts determine how best to prevent, minimize, or mitigate those risks, and accurately communicate those risks to patients, prescribers, and regulatory agencies in a timely manner. Product Risk Management Amgen conducts ongoing benefit/risk assessments of our products whenever new benefit or risk information related to the product becomes available. Amgen has in-place a structured risk management planning process to establish appropriate and necessary actions needed to communicate and minimize the risks of a product. Our process is designed to engage the right stakeholders in the benefit/risk assessment and the development of any risk minimization activities. Through the implementation of risk minimization activities, some of the risks associated with the use of a product may be mitigated or managed in patients. Amgen routinely communicates benefit-risk assessments of our products to regulatory agencies by submitting aggregate periodic reports which are evaluated by applicable regulatory agencies. Product Risk Communication Amgen is committed to timely, appropriate, and transparent communication of risks related to our products to patients, healthcare professionals, and regulatory agencies. For developmental products, the risks are communicated to investigators through the investigator brochure, as well as through updates to informed consent forms. Subjects participating in our trials will receive the information via the informed consent process and discussions with study investigators. For marketed products, the risks are communicated to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals through product labeling, and to patients through updates to the product label, as well as patient leaflets, if required. Regulatory authorities have the final decision regarding the content and language included in the prescribing information and as a result, labeling documents may vary across countries or regions where the product is approved for commercial use. In addition to updates of the relevant documents for any new clinically significant safety information, other risk minimization communication tools, such as direct letters to investigators and/or healthcare providers, are used as appropriate for timely communication of a new risk. Regulatory Reporting Amgen works collaboratively and transparently with world-wide regulatory agencies to achieve the common objective of protecting patient safety. During the clinical development of a product, Amgen partners with regulatory agencies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products. Our marketing applications include comprehensive safety and efficacy data that regulatory agencies use to make their decision with regards to product approval. Following approval, Amgen continues to inform health authorities on the safety of our products through the submission of expedited individual case safety reports, periodic aggregate safety reports, clinical study reports, and other relevant communication on safety issues in a timely manner consistent with applicable regulations.

Please refer to our Adverse Event and Product Complaint Reporting Policy for additional information It is Amgen's policy to comply with all regulations and laws worldwide relating to reporting Adverse Events, Other Safety Findings and Product Complaints (collectively known as Reportable Events). Individuals subject to this policy are required to report all Reportable Events within one business day of learning of it. Adverse Events (AE) An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered an Amgen product and which is not necessarily caused by the Amgen product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, combination product, or medical device, whether or not considered related to the product. This includes: Any clinically significant worsening of a pre-existing condition; or An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a product. Other Safety Findings (OSFs) The following are considered Other Safety Findings regardless of whether they are associated with an AE and they must be reported to Amgen: Use of an Amgen product while pregnant and/or breast feeding. This includes pregnancies in women whose sexual partner took, or is taking, an Amgen product. Medication errors Overdose Underdose Misuse is defined as the intentional improper use of a medicinal product, combination product or medical device not in accordance with the authorized product information. Abuse Addiction Transmission of an infectious agent through a contaminated Amgen product Accidental Exposure Occupational Exposure Lack or loss of therapeutic efficacy Missed dose, if not taken prior to the next scheduled Unexpected therapeutic benefit Reports of patient "death" after exposure to Amgen's product where no other details are provided (e.g., fatal outcomes) Off-label use of an Amgen product defined as the intentional use of a product in a manner inconsistent with the locally approved label, i.e., a different dose, use, indication or patient population than that approved in the local label. U.S. Commercial field staff are not required to report off-label use unless the off-label use is associated with an AE. However, US Commercial field staff must report all other AEs, PCs and OSFs irrespective of whether the event is from on-label or off- label use. Product Complaints (PC) Any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a drug, combination product, or device after it is released for distribution to market or clinic by either: (1) Amgen or (2) distributors or partners for whom Amgen manufactures the material. This includes all components distributed with the drug, such as packaging, drug containers, delivery system, labelling, and inserts. Use Error is a situation in which the outcome of device use was different than intended, but not due to malfunction of the device. The error may have been due to a poorly designed device, or it may have been used in a situation that promoted incorrect usage.  Use errors are considered product complaints What to Report When submitting a Reportable Event, you will need to have the following information ready: The identifiable patient: The person who has taken or been administered the product (e.g. age, gender, etc.), in compliance with local privacy laws. An identifiable reporter: The source that reported the event (e.g. patient, health care provider, friend, etc.), in compliance with local privacy laws. The medicinal product: Amgen product name, indication and lot number if known. The reportable event: Description of the AE, other safety finding or product complaint. Please report as much relevant information as possible. You should still report even if you do not have all the required information. It does not matter whether the Reportable Event is thought to be caused or not thought to be caused by taking an Amgen product – all AEs, OSFs and PCs must be reported. Report it, even if it is listed in the approved company prescribing information as a possible side effect. When in doubt, report it.

ASCVD is defined as the buildup of cholesterol plaque in arteries and includes events such as heart attack and stroke. "The African American Heart Study is a unique collaborative study including community outreach in partnership with trusted organizations to help improve our understanding of the disproportionate higher incidence of Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease progression in African Americans and hopefully provide insights of ways to address barriers in clinical trial access," said Ponda Motsepe-Ditshego, M.D., vice president, global medical and head of Amgen's Representation in Clinical Research team. "At Amgen, our mission is to serve patients, and important to that mission is expanding clinical trial access and diverse representation in the community setting to provide a full picture of how a disease impacts certain groups." Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of all Americans, and the cardiovascular risk for African Americans is even higher. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, African Americans are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites.1-2 Lp(a) is a presumed independent risk factor for heart disease; levels are genetically determined and are known to differ by race and ethnicity.3-6 African American individuals show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white populations, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in individuals of European descent.7 This leaves the association between Lp(a) levels and incident ASCVD in persons of African American descent uncertain and important to investigate further to understand drivers of cardiovascular risk in African Americans. Amgen has initiated the African American Heart Study to bridge this gap.    "People of all races and ethnicities can have high levels of Lp(a), but it appears to be more common in African Americans. I am excited about the African American Heart Study because we have the opportunity to study up to 5,000 self-identified African Americans, who have been so often underrepresented in studies, in order to gain a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of Lp(a) and to determine if African American patients are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease," said Elizabeth Ofili, M.D., M.P.H., FACC, professor of medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine and principal investigator of the study. "The results of this study will potentially provide insights that will help determine which types of patients would benefit most from future therapy." This prospective case-control study design will enroll 2,500 self-identified African Americans with ASCVD and 2,500 self-identified African Americans without ASCVD from cardiology and primary care practices across the United States. Enrollment is voluntary. ABC and MSM will conduct community outreach, as well as identify sites through the Health 360x Clinical Trial Network and Registry. The Health 360x Network practice sites are trusted providers, crucial to the success of the African American Heart Study. The Health 360x Clinical Trial Network and Registry is funded by the National Institutes of Health to support clinical trials in community-based practices.9 Amgen's subsidiary, deCODE genetics, based in Iceland, with its world-class human genetics capabilities, will sequence and analyze DNA, RNA, and protein markers from participants' blood samples. With three years of follow-up planned, the broad omics data analyzed by deCODE will help Amgen broaden the understanding of ASCVD and other diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans. The learnings may also inform future clinical trials and drug development. "Increasing the diversity in our clinical trials is essential to achieving our ambition of serving all patients. This requires us to think differently than we have in the past about how we design and conduct our trials," said Rob Lenz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Global Development at Amgen. "To do that, we are educating the community on why this is critical and building trusted relationships with our partners. We also are training external investigators and building new capabilities that will help provide them with the right infrastructures in communities of underserved patient populations to make projects like the African American Heart Study possible." The African American Heart Study is emblematic of Amgen's unwavering commitment to diversity in clinical trials. In 2020, Amgen launched its Representation in Clinical Research team to accelerate its work in promoting diversity in clinical trials and is focused on improving clinical trial diversity and proportional representation by addressing the systemic issues that deter people from participating in research, especially those who have been historically excluded due to race, ethnicity, sex, age, and other factors. About the African American Heart Study The main objective of the study is to determine associations between Lp(a) levels, sequence variants, clinical factors and cardiovascular outcomes in African Americans. Participants will be followed for at least three years leveraging real-world evidence from electronic health records. About Lp(a) Lp(a) is genetically determined and presumed to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 4-6 Although an agreed upon threshold for elevated Lp(a) is not firmly established, it has been estimated that approximately 20% of adults have Lp(a) >125 nmol/L (or approximately 50 mg/dL).3-6 Evidence has emerged from pathophysiological, epidemiologic, and genetic studies on the potential role of elevated Lp(a) in contributing to myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.3-8 About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful.

AMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto) is the first biosimilar to HUMIRA® to launch in the U.S. and is sparking conversations about these biologic medicines.1 Biosimilars are made from living cells, which requires unique proprietary manufacturing processes, along with specialized knowledge and significant investments in the right equipment and trained personnel. Without the right capabilities, expertise and manufacturing processes, the development of biosimilars could be interrupted, leaving patients without the medicines they need. For Kristen Elson, Global Operations Director, Biosimilars, and Reggie Ray, U.S. Operations Lead, leading AMJEVITA’s product delivery team and ensuring patients receive the medicines they need every time is their team’s top priority. “Manufacturing biologics, including biosimilars, is an incredibly complicated process that requires immense knowledge, experience and quality control,” said Elson. “The technology we’re using to develop and manufacture biologics today is more precise, more accurate and more quantitative than in years past – giving us the ability to look at multiple attributes to be able to bring reliable, high-quality medicines to patients.” “Amgen is one of the only biotech companies that is vertically integrated, meaning we use the same scientists, manufacturing plants and quality systems to develop our biologic products, including biosimilars,” Ray added. “And we’re taking what we learn from developing innovative products to inform how we manufacture our biosimilars, and vice versa.” Amgen has supplied biosimilars to more than 750,000 patients in over 60 countries around the world, even throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the importance of consistent, reliable and quality supply.2 “Without a strong supply chain and manufacturing processes, patients might not receive the medicines they need when they need them,” said Ray. “That’s where I think the Amgen difference lies. We have a nearly unmatched supply reliability record, thanks to the aspects that make our process different: our deep expertise, our vertically integrated pipeline, and of course the people at Amgen who care so much about their work. Everyone has a common goal — they want to ensure that we are delivering to patients. I've seen people give lots of time, sweat and tears to all of our molecules, including AMJEVITA.” Amgen's manufacturing team prepares first shipments of AMJEVITA to send to patients in the U.S. Currently, Amgen has one of the largest biosimilar portfolios in the industry with 11 total biosimilars in market or under development, including five approved biosimilars currently launched in the U.S.3 “I’m incredibly proud of the work we do on the Operations team,” said Elson. “The complexity of developing biosimilars is a fulfilling challenge, but knowing that what we do every day has a direct impact on real people’s lives is what keeps me excited to come to work each day.” Hear from Laura, who lives with ulcerative colitis, as she shares her experience on a biosimilar and her treatment journey in the video below.  *Humira® is a registered trademark of AbbVie, Inc.

Amgen. 2023 Data on file. Amgen. 2023 In the U.S., AMJEVITA is indicated for: reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, alone or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs. reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older, alone or in combination with methotrexate. reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis, alone or in combination with non-biologic DMARDs. reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients. The effectiveness of adalimumab products has not been established in patients who have lost response to or were intolerant to TNF blockers. the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. AMJEVITA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician. AMJEVITA™ U.S. Important Safety Information SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with AMJEVITA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue AMJEVITA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before AMJEVITA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to AMJEVITA use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with AMJEVITA prior to initiating therapy in patients: 1. with chronic or recurrent infection, 2. who have been exposed to TB, 3. with a history of opportunistic infection, 4. who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic, 5. with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with AMJEVITA, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy. Do not start AMJEVITA during an active infection, including localized infections. Patients older than 65 years, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy. Drug interactions with biologic products: A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. An increased risk of serious infections has been seen with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no demonstrated added benefit in patients with RA. Concomitant administration of AMJEVITA with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra or abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based on the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF-blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. Consider the risks and benefits of AMJEVITA prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy. In clinical trials of some TNF blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies were observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control patients. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was reported during clinical trials for adalimumab-treated patients. Examine all patients, particularly those with a history of prolonged immunosuppressant or PUVA therapy, for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with AMJEVITA. In adalimumab clinical trials, there was an approximate 3-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk of lymphoma than the general population, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Postmarketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use. Approximately half of the postmarketing cases of malignancies in children, adolescents, and young adults receiving TNF blockers were lymphomas; other cases included rare malignancies associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually observed in children and adolescents. HYPERSENSITIVITY Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, stop AMJEVITA and institute appropriate therapy. HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION Use of TNF blockers, including AMJEVITA, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them during and after AMJEVITA treatment. Discontinue AMJEVITA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming AMJEVITA after HBV treatment. NEUROLOGIC REACTIONS TNF blockers, including adalimumab products, have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.Exercise caution when considering AMJEVITA for patients with these disorders; discontinuation of AMJEVITA should be considered if any of these disorders develop. HEMATOLOGICAL REACTIONS Rare reports of pancytopenia, including aplastic anemia, have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. Consider stopping AMJEVITA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Worsening or new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have been observed with adalimumab products; exercise caution and monitor carefully. AUTOIMMUNITY Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop. IMMUNIZATIONS Patients on AMJEVITA should not receive live vaccines. Pediatric patients, if possible, should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating AMJEVITA therapy. Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero exposed infant. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in adalimumab clinical trials (>10%) were: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache, and rash.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Worsening or new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have been observed with adalimumab products; exercise caution and monitor carefully. AUTOIMMUNITY Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop. IMMUNIZATIONS Patients on AMJEVITA should not receive live vaccines. Pediatric patients, if possible, should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating AMJEVITA therapy. Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero exposed infant. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in adalimumab clinical trials (>10%) were: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache, and rash.

ASCVD is defined as the buildup of cholesterol plaque in arteries and includes events such as heart attack and stroke. "The African American Heart Study is a unique collaborative study including community outreach in partnership with trusted organizations to help improve our understanding of the disproportionate higher incidence of Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease progression in African Americans and hopefully provide insights of ways to address barriers in clinical trial access," said Ponda Motsepe-Ditshego, M.D., vice president, global medical and head of Amgen's Representation in Clinical Research team. "At Amgen, our mission is to serve patients, and important to that mission is expanding clinical trial access and diverse representation in the community setting to provide a full picture of how a disease impacts certain groups." Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of all Americans, and the cardiovascular risk for African Americans is even higher. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, African Americans are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites.1-2 Lp(a) is a presumed independent risk factor for heart disease; levels are genetically determined and are known to differ by race and ethnicity.3-6 African American individuals show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white populations, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in individuals of European descent.7 This leaves the association between Lp(a) levels and incident ASCVD in persons of African American descent uncertain and important to investigate further to understand drivers of cardiovascular risk in African Americans. Amgen has initiated the African American Heart Study to bridge this gap.    "People of all races and ethnicities can have high levels of Lp(a), but it appears to be more common in African Americans. I am excited about the African American Heart Study because we have the opportunity to study up to 5,000 self-identified African Americans, who have been so often underrepresented in studies, in order to gain a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of Lp(a) and to determine if African American patients are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease," said Elizabeth Ofili, M.D., M.P.H., FACC, professor of medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine and principal investigator of the study. "The results of this study will potentially provide insights that will help determine which types of patients would benefit most from future therapy." This prospective case-control study design will enroll 2,500 self-identified African Americans with ASCVD and 2,500 self-identified African Americans without ASCVD from cardiology and primary care practices across the United States. Enrollment is voluntary. ABC and MSM will conduct community outreach, as well as identify sites through the Health 360x Clinical Trial Network and Registry. The Health 360x Network practice sites are trusted providers, crucial to the success of the African American Heart Study. The Health 360x Clinical Trial Network and Registry is funded by the National Institutes of Health to support clinical trials in community-based practices.9 Amgen's subsidiary, deCODE genetics, based in Iceland, with its world-class human genetics capabilities, will sequence and analyze DNA, RNA, and protein markers from participants' blood samples. With three years of follow-up planned, the broad omics data analyzed by deCODE will help Amgen broaden the understanding of ASCVD and other diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans. The learnings may also inform future clinical trials and drug development. "Increasing the diversity in our clinical trials is essential to achieving our ambition of serving all patients. This requires us to think differently than we have in the past about how we design and conduct our trials," said Rob Lenz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Global Development at Amgen. "To do that, we are educating the community on why this is critical and building trusted relationships with our partners. We also are training external investigators and building new capabilities that will help provide them with the right infrastructures in communities of underserved patient populations to make projects like the African American Heart Study possible." The African American Heart Study is emblematic of Amgen's unwavering commitment to diversity in clinical trials. In 2020, Amgen launched its Representation in Clinical Research team to accelerate its work in promoting diversity in clinical trials and is focused on improving clinical trial diversity and proportional representation by addressing the systemic issues that deter people from participating in research, especially those who have been historically excluded due to race, ethnicity, sex, age, and other factors. About the African American Heart Study The main objective of the study is to determine associations between Lp(a) levels, sequence variants, clinical factors and cardiovascular outcomes in African Americans. Participants will be followed for at least three years leveraging real-world evidence from electronic health records. About Lp(a) Lp(a) is genetically determined and presumed to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 4-6 Although an agreed upon threshold for elevated Lp(a) is not firmly established, it has been estimated that approximately 20% of adults have Lp(a) >125 nmol/L (or approximately 50 mg/dL).3-6 Evidence has emerged from pathophysiological, epidemiologic, and genetic studies on the potential role of elevated Lp(a) in contributing to myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.3-8 About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.
