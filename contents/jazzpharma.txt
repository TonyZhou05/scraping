The world has only recently started to recognize the true potential of cannabinoid science to bring FDA-approved medicines to patients in a new frontier of medicine. Cannabinoids interact with many neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems in the human body, offering the potential to meet currently unmet needs of patients in multiple treatment areas. Through our GW Cannabinoid Platform and research into endocannabinoids, Jazz is particularly well-positioned at exploring cannabinoid-based therapeutic prospects. At Jazz, we seek solutions for rare or complex diseases, and work to make those solutions available to the often-overlooked patients who need them. In 2021, we acquired GW Pharmaceuticals and integrated two teams with a shared vision of developing innovative and differentiated therapies that advance science and caring about patients with often-overlooked diseases. As a leader in cannabinoid science and the first and only company to receive a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a plant-derived cannabinoid medicine, GW Pharmaceuticals brings a deep scientific understanding of the pharmacological effects, unique formulation, rigorous clinical testing and regulated manufacturing process of this growing treatment category. We are building an even stronger company together and look forward to the greater impact we will continue to drive for patients, caregivers, health care providers, and other stakeholders in the cannabinoid space. Jazz’s existing early-stage research into endocannabinoid therapies, combined with the world-leading GW Cannabinoid Platform, has expanded and diversified our commercial portfolio and growing neuroscience pipeline into several therapeutic areas. To learn more about Jazz’s neuroscience pipeline, please visit here. GW Cannabinoid Platform Cannabinoid science has opened the door to the development of FDA-approved plant-derived cannabinoid medications that are used to treat a number of neurological diseases. Over more than two decades, GW Pharmaceuticals, now a part of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, established a world-leading cannabinoid science platform to develop a deep, innovative pipeline of early and late-stage cannabinoid product candidates and highly specialized growing and manufacturing expertise. Through these committed efforts, GW developed and commercialized the world’s first prescription medicine derived from the cannabis plant. Unlike non-FDA-approved cannabidiol products or cannabis-derived products, GW’s regulatory-approved portfolio ensures that every product manufactured has a safety and efficacy profile that has been thoroughly evaluated in clinical trials, independently peer-reviewed, approved by regulatory authorities (FDA, MHRA, etc.), and consistently manufactured to ensure the highest quality standards are met. To learn more about the difference between FDA-approved and non-FDA-approved cannabinoid products, please visit https://www.cannabinoidclinical.com/™. Building on GW’s success as a pioneer in this emerging treatment area, Jazz continues to trailblaze to enable the development, manufacture, and commercialization of regulatory approved plant-derived cannabinoid medicines with the potential to transform the lives of patients and their families.

To do this, we conduct clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of investigational medicines, and the data generated from these trials allows us to obtain the necessary approvals from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which allow for broad access to medicines. At Jazz, we believe that wherever possible, use of an investigational medicine for a patient as part of a clinical trial is preferable because clinical trials can generate data that may lead to the approval of products and, consequently, to wider availability. Conducting clinical trials is extremely complex and challenging. The ultimate goal is the rigorous testing of the clinical product with the aim of securing regulatory approval and enabling the medicine to be available to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. Jazz complies with good clinical practices and takes steps to help ensure the quality and integrity of our clinical trials and to minimize risks to current research participants and future patients. For a list of clinical trials currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov. However, we also recognize that in some extreme circumstances, when participating in a clinical trial is not possible, patients facing serious or life-threatening conditions may seek special access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial setting. Consistent with applicable laws and regulations, Jazz may provide patients with access to investigational medicines through Expanded/Early Access Programs (EAPs) when there is sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the investigational medicine to support its use in the particular circumstance. It is important to note that terminology used can vary from country to country and dependent on the way that the medicine is accessed. Although often referred to as Expanded Access Programs or Early Access Programs, these types of access can also be known as Compassionate Use, Pre-approval Access, Named Patient Access and Emergency Use. EAPs do not apply to the use of a currently marketed medicine for an indication outside of the approved label. Types of Early Access Programs In general, there are two ways that Jazz can grant Early Access to an investigational medicine. The type of program available may be dependent on local laws and regulations. It is important to note that terminology used can vary from country to country and in some instances different countries use identical terminology to describe different approaches. Individual Patient Access – where a qualified healthcare professional requests an investigational medicine for use for a single patient because, in their judgement, currently available therapies are not satisfactory. This request may or may not require approval by the national health authority dependent on local regulation. Jazz may also make an investigational medicine available on a named, single patient basis through a third party provider in some territories. Multiple Patient Access – This type of program is commonly referred to as Compassionate Use in EU or Expanded Access in the United States and describes the process by which an investigational medicine is made available to a defined group of patients with an unmet medical need under a specific treatment protocol. In most countries this type of program is initiated by Jazz and approved by the national health authority. Individual Patient Access Multiple Patient Access Eligibility Criteria Jazz considers many factors when evaluating a request for individual patient access, also known as named patient access in Europe, to an investigational medicine, such as the strength of the clinical data, the benefit-risk profile, the potential impact on the clinical development program, the phase of development, the country-specific regulations, and probability and timing of regulatory approval within the applicant’s country, though the medicine may be approved in another country. In determining whether named patient access is appropriate outside of a clinical trial, the criteria Jazz evaluates include the following: Jazz has sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the investigational medicine to support its use in the particular circumstance. The disease is serious or life threatening. There are no beneficial available alternative treatments or patients have exhausted all other therapies. A clinical study is not available, either because patients are ineligible or because they have no access to the trial. The efficacy and safety data available at the time are of sufficient strength to determine whether the benefit to patient would likely outweigh the potential risks. Access is compliant with local rules and laws. The request must be made by the patient’s treating physician, unsolicited by Jazz Pharmaceuticals or any other individual or organization. The patient’s treating physician determined that there are sufficient safety and efficacy data, including dosing information, to support the use of the investigational medicine, that there is no comparable or satisfactory therapy available to treat the patient’s disease and that the probable risk to the patient from the investigational medicine is not greater than the probable risk from the disease itself. Jazz will consider the evaluation criteria in determining whether to offer individual patient access; however, Jazz cannot make a guarantee that named patient access will be available, and, even if a named access program is offered, Jazz cannot make a guarantee that the investigational medicine will be available to a particular patient. Decisions regarding potential named patient access to investigational medicines can only be made, in certain circumstances, after in-depth discussion between Jazz’s clinical teams and the patient’s qualified healthcare professional and in line with required national health authority approval, if applicable. Jazz is committed to a fair and impartial evaluation of each request for access to our investigational medicines. Therefore, all decisions are based on clinical circumstances. Whenever possible, patients will be referred to ongoing clinical trials as the primary way to access investigational medicines.

"2022 was a year of significant execution across our business that exemplified our purpose to innovate to transform the lives of patients and their families and advanced Jazz towards achieving Vision 2025. Our substantial top-line growth was led by the strength of our commercial franchises, including the continued adoption of Xywav® across both narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), meaningful Epidiolex® growth, and robust demand for Rylaze®, driven by critical unmet patient need," said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. "In addition to achieving considerable revenue growth in 2022, we generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations and significantly improved our operational efficiency in line with our objectives for Vision 2025. Our strong financial performance, alongside a more disciplined approach to capital allocation, allowed us to delever our balance sheet six months ahead of our stated target, while investing in multiple strategic transactions that have the potential to create meaningful long-term value for patients and shareholders. We are proud of our 2022 accomplishments, which position us in 2023 to grow our top-line revenues through continued commercial execution, enhance our pipeline investments in innovation, and demonstrate continued progress towards achieving Vision 2025." "Building on several transformative years for R&D at Jazz, we have enhanced the breadth and depth of our pipeline, as well as our capabilities. In 2022, we added three promising candidates to our pipeline: zanidatamab, a late-stage novel HER2-targeted bispecific antibody with biparatopic binding, JZP441, an orexin-2 receptor agonist, and JZP898, a differentiated, conditionally-activated interferon alpha (IFNα) INDUKINE™ molecule. We're very encouraged by the positive top-line results from the pivotal trial of zanidatamab in biliary tract cancers (BTC) and the first overall survival data for zanidatamab from the Phase 2 first-line (1L) metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) trial that was announced at ASCO GI," said Rob Iannone, M.D., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, global head of research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. "With the initiation of multiple clinical trials in 2022, we continue to expand our pipeline into disease areas with significant unmet patient need and market potential, including difficult-to-treat cancers and Parkinson's disease tremor, and we've rapidly progressed JZP441 since bringing it in-house to enable initial proof-of-concept in healthy volunteers in 2023. We enter 2023 with meaningfully increased investment in R&D, which coupled with our upcoming catalysts and expanded capabilities, gives us confidence in delivering sustainable long-term value." Key Highlights Business and Execution Xywav became the Company's largest product by net sales in 4Q22, annualizing at more than $1 billion as a result of continued adoption in both narcolepsy and IH. Achieved a significant milestone exiting October 2022, with more narcolepsy patients taking Xywav than Xyrem®. Expect Xywav to remain the oxybate of choice in 2023. Epidyolex® delivered compelling growth in 4Q22 and is now launched and reimbursed in all five key European markets: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. Received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Rylaze supplemental Biologics Licensing Application (sBLA) for Monday/Wednesday/Friday (MWF) intramuscular (IM) dosing. Strategic corporate development further expanded R&D pipeline with the addition of zanidatamab, a novel late-stage oncology asset. Positive top-line results from the pivotal trial of zanidatamab in BTC in December 2022 and the first overall survival data for zanidatamab from a Phase 2 trial in 1L HER2-expressing metastatic GEA in January 2023. Enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 trial for suvecaltamide (JZP385) in Parkinson's disease tremor in 4Q22. Financial Growing and durable commercial franchises drove 2022 total revenues of $3.7 billion; 18% increase compared to 2021. Successfully delevered balance sheet in 2022; exiting the year at 2.9x adjusted net leverage ratio1. Focus on disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence drove: Significantly increased cash from operations of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $779 million in 2021. Improved leverage of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which as a percentage of sales decreased significantly in 4Q22 and FY22 relative to the same periods in 2021. Ability to invest nearly $450 million in strategic transactions in 2022, while still achieving net leverage target. 2023 total revenue guidance of $3,675 to $3,875 million, 3% growth at the mid-point. Total revenue guidance is underpinned by expectations of continued growth in net sales of Xywav, Epidiolex/Epidyolex and the oncology portfolio, a continued decline in net sales of Xyrem and royalties on net sales of Authorized Generics of Xyrem.      1. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Non-GAAP net leverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Business Updates Key Commercial Products Oxybate (Xywav and Xyrem): Net product sales for the combined oxybate business increased 10% to $1,978.9 million in 2022 and increased 12% to $528.9 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. Average active oxybate patients on therapy was approximately 18,000 in 4Q22, an increase of 11% compared to the same period in 2021. Xywav (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution: Xywav net product sales increased 79% to $958.4 million in 2022 and increased 54% to $281.4 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. Xywav became the Company's largest product by net product sales in 4Q22, annualizing at more than $1 billion as a result of continued adoption in both narcolepsy and IH. There were approximately 10,300 active Xywav patients exiting 4Q22. Xywav for Narcolepsy: There were approximately 8,550 narcolepsy patients taking Xywav exiting 4Q22. Achieved another significant milestone exiting October 2022, with more narcolepsy patients taking Xywav than Xyrem. The benefits of lowering sodium intake continue to resonate with patients and prescribers. In June 2021, FDA recognized seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), through July 2027, for Xywav and published its summary of clinical superiority findings. Xywav for Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH): There were approximately 1,750 IH patients taking Xywav exiting 4Q22. The Company has achieved its goal of obtaining similar payer coverage to narcolepsy, with coverage now at approximately 90% of commercial lives for IH. The Company launched Xywav, the first and only treatment approved by FDA for IH, in November 2021. Initial launch efforts have focused on the approximately 37,000 currently diagnosed patients in the U.S. who are actively seeking healthcare. Healthcare providers are excited to have a treatment option with positive and compelling clinical trial results that addresses IH and not just its symptoms. FDA recognized ODE for IH in January 2022, extending regulatory exclusivity to August 2028. Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution: Xyrem net product sales decreased 19% to $1,020.5 million in 2022 and decreased 14% to $247.5 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting the continued adoption of Xywav by patients with narcolepsy. Epidiolex/Epidyolex (cannabidiol): Epidiolex/Epidyolex net product sales increased 12%, on a proforma basis, to $736.4 million in 2022 and increased 7% to $207.0 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. The Company successfully completed the pricing and reimbursement process and the commercial launch of Epidyolex in France in 4Q22. Epidyolex is now launched in all five key European markets: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. In 4Q22, the Company enrolled the first patient in a pivotal Phase 3 trial of Epidyolex for Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and tuberous sclerosis in Japan. Zepzelca® (lurbinectedin):  Zepzelca net product sales increased 9% to $269.9 million in 2022 and increased 11% to $72.0 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. The Company is pleased Zepzelca continues to be the treatment of choice in the second-line (2L) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) setting. Zepzelca development program highlights: The EMERGE-201 Phase 2 basket trial evaluating Zepzelca as monotherapy in select relapsed/refractory solid tumors is ongoing. Phase 3 trial in partnership with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) to evaluate 1L use of Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), compared to Tecentriq alone, as maintenance therapy in patients with extensive-stage SCLC after induction chemotherapy is ongoing. The Company expects complete enrollment in the trial by the end of 2023. The Company's partner, PharmaMar, is conducting the Phase 3 confirmatory trial, LAGOON, in 2L SCLC. If positive, this trial could confirm the benefit of Zepzelca in the treatment of SCLC when patients progress following 1L treatment with a platinum-based regimen. Rylaze (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn): Rylaze net product sales were $281.7 million in 2022 compared to $85.6 million in 2021, following commercial launch in July 2021, and increased 25% to $81.0 million in 4Q22 compared to the same period in 2021. Strong demand for Rylaze in the first year of launch reflects the significant unmet patient need for a high-quality, reliable supply of Erwinia asparaginase for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In November 2022, the Company received FDA approval for a MWF IM dosing schedule for Rylaze. In May 2022, the Company completed the Marketing Authorization Application submission to European Medicines Agency for a MWF dosing schedule and IM and intravenous (IV) administration for JZP458 (approved as Rylaze in the U.S.) with potential for approval in 2023. The Company is also advancing the program for potential submission, approval and launch in Japan. In April 2022, the Company submitted an sBLA for IV administration. In February 2023, the Company received a complete response letter from FDA requesting additional clinical data on the IV administration of Rylaze. There is no impact on the approved product labeling for Rylaze IM administration. Corporate Development Zanidatamab Agreement1: On October 19, 2022, the Company and Zymeworks Inc. announced an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement1 and on December 21, 2022, Jazz and Zymeworks announced Jazz exercised its option to continue with the exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab in key markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Initial focus is in BTC and GEA with potential to transform the current standard of care in multiple HER2-expressing cancers. In December 2022, Zymeworks announced positive top-line data from the pivotal HERIZON-BTC-01 clinical trial investigating zanidatamab as monotherapy in patients with previously treated HER2-amplified and expressing BTC. Zanidatamab as monotherapy produced a confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 41.3% and median duration of response of 12.9 months in patients. In January 2023, the Company and Zymeworks announced the first overall survival data of 84% at 18 months from a Phase 2 trial of zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy in 1L patients with HER2-expressing metastatic GEA. The pivotal trial, HERIZON-GEA-01, evaluating zanidatamab in 1L GEA is ongoing and top-line data are expected in 2024.         1. Exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab across all indications in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia/Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks. Key Pipeline Highlights JZP150: JZP150, a selective fatty acid amide hydrolase, or FAAH, inhibitor, is in clinical development for the potential treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patient enrollment is ongoing and top-line data read-out is anticipated in late 2023. The Company received Fast Track Designation for JZP150 development in PTSD from FDA, underscoring the significant unmet medical needs of patients. Suvecaltamide (JZP385): Suvecaltamide, a highly selective modulator of T-type calcium channels, is in clinical development for the treatment of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease tremor. Patient enrollment is ongoing in the Phase 2b ET trial and top-line data read-out is anticipated in 1H24. In 4Q22, the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 2 trial in patients with Parkinson's disease tremor. JZP441: JZP441, is a potent, highly selective oral orexin-2 receptor agonist designed to activate orexin signaling with the potential to be applicable in the treatment of narcolepsy, IH and other sleep disorders. In 4Q22, the first participant was enrolled into the Phase 1 development program to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of JZP441 in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers. The Company expects initial proof of concept in healthy volunteers in 2023. JZP815: The Company enrolled the first patient in a Phase 1 trial evaluating JZP815 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with MAPK pathway alterations. The pan-RAF inhibitor program is part of a novel class of next-generation precision oncology therapies that has the potential to benefit cancer patients with high unmet needs in multiple different solid tumors. JZP898: JZP898 is an engineered IFNα cytokine pro-drug that is activated specifically within the tumor microenvironment where it can stimulate IFNα receptors on cancer-fighting immune effector cells. The aim is to minimize the severe toxicities that have been observed with systemically active recombinant IFNα therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Type 1 interferon signal transduction by IFNα agonism is a clinically validated mechanism of action, and IFNα has been shown to work synergistically in combination with other proven therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies and chemotherapy. This allows for potential application across a wide range of cancer types, combination regimens and lines of therapy. The Company expects to file an Investigational New Drug application for JZP898 in the U.S. this year.

The income tax benefit for 2022, also includes the tax impact of an impairment of acquired IPR&D related to nabiximols. The GAAP income tax expense for 2021, included an expense of $259.9 million related to the change in the statutory tax rate in the U.K.   Three Months Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31, (In thousands, except percentages) 2022  2021  2022  2021 Non-GAAP adjusted:        Cost of product sales $       93,386  $       58,110  $     251,941  $     205,401 Gross margin 90.3 %  93.5 %  93.1 %  93.3 % Selling, general and administrative $     319,763  $     328,656  $  1,134,703  $  1,105,048 % of total revenues 32.9 %  36.7 %  31.0 %  35.7 % Research and development $     160,105  $     140,101  $     521,085  $     451,026 % of total revenues 16.5 %  15.6 %  14.2 %  14.6 % Acquired in-process research and development $     375,000  $              —  $     444,148  $              — Income tax expense (benefit)(1) $      (43,301)  $       37,254  $       94,695  $     148,764 Effective tax rate(1) 92.6 %  12.3 %  9.1 %  13.0 %       1. The non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense (benefit), for 4Q22 and 2022, includes the tax impact of payments made for acquired IPR&D in those periods. Changes in operating expenses in 2022 and 4Q22 over the prior year periods are primarily due to the following: Cost of product sales increased in 2022 and 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, due to an expense for past royalties payable under a settlement agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. In addition, cost of product sales, on a GAAP basis, in 2022 included increased inventory fair value step-up expense of $50.3 million compared to 2021, driven by the inclusion of a full year expense. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, on a GAAP basis, decreased in 2022 and 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, due to lower GW acquisition related transaction and integration expenses and lower Sunosi® (solriamfetol) related costs, offset by restructuring costs and costs related to program terminations and increased investment in sales and marketing, primarily relating to Xywav and, for the full year period, the inclusion of GW related headcount costs for the full year and the loss on the disposal of Sunosi. SG&A expenses, on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the inclusion of GW related headcount costs for the full year and increased investment in sales and marketing, offset by lower Sunosi related costs. SG&A expenses, on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, decreased in 4Q22 compared to 4Q21 primarily due to lower Sunosi related costs, offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased in 2022 and 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, primarily due to the addition of costs related to zanidatamab, JZP898 and JZP441, and increased costs for JZP150, offset by a reduction in costs related to JZP458 (Rylaze), following its approval. R&D costs also increased in 2022, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, due to increased compensation related expenses driven by the inclusion of GW related headcount costs for the full period. Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense in 4Q22, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, related to payments of $375.0 million to Zymeworks, in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2022, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, also included upfront payments of $50.0 million to Sumitomo in relation to our licensing agreement and $15.0 million to Werewolf, in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement. The impairment charge in 2022, on a GAAP basis, related to an acquired IPR&D asset impairment relating to the discontinuation of our nabiximols program. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $881.5 million, and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's long-term debt was $5.8 billion compared to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company had undrawn borrowing capacity under a revolving credit facility of $500 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated $1,272.0 million of cash from operations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Jazz Pharmaceuticals' financial results and guidance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses certain non-GAAP (also referred to as adjusted or non-GAAP adjusted) financial measures in this press release and the accompanying tables. In particular, the Company presents non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (and the related per share measure) and its line item components, as well as certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures derived therefrom, including non-GAAP adjusted gross margin percentage and non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (and the related per share measure) and its line item components exclude from GAAP reported net loss (and the related per share measure) and its line item components certain items, as detailed in the reconciliation tables that follow, and in the case of non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (and the related per share measure), adjust for the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments and the impact of the change in the statutory tax rate in the U.K. In this regard, the components of non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss), including non-GAAP adjusted cost of product sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) measure. The Company also uses a non-GAAP net leverage ratio calculated as net debt (defined as total GAAP debt, net of cash and cash equivalents) divided by non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the most recent period of four consecutive completed fiscal quarters. EBITDA is defined as net loss before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain other charges and adjustments as detailed in the non-GAAP net leverage ratio reconciliation table that follows and is calculated in accordance with the definition of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA as set out in the Company's credit agreement entered into in May 2021 (the Credit Agreement). The Company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors and analysts and that each of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors' and analysts' ability to meaningfully compare the Company's results from period to period and to its forward-looking guidance, to identify operating trends in the Company's business and to understand the Company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are regularly used by investors and analysts to model and track the Company's financial performance. Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management also regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company's business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part on certain of these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures are important internal measurements for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management, the Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts since these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the Company uses in assessing its own operating performance and making operating decisions. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles in the reconciliation tables that follow. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company has ceased, and may in the future cease, to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the Company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in this press release and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

"In addition to achieving considerable revenue growth in 2022, we generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations and significantly improved our operational efficiency in line with our objectives for Vision 2025. Our strong financial performance, alongside a more disciplined approach to capital allocation, allowed us to delever our balance sheet six months ahead of our stated target, while investing in multiple strategic transactions that have the potential to create meaningful long-term value for patients and shareholders. We are proud of our 2022 accomplishments, which position us in 2023 to grow our top-line revenues through continued commercial execution, enhance our pipeline investments in innovation, and demonstrate continued progress towards achieving Vision 2025." "Building on several transformative years for R&D at Jazz, we have enhanced the breadth and depth of our pipeline, as well as our capabilities. In 2022, we added three promising candidates to our pipeline: zanidatamab, a late-stage novel HER2-targeted bispecific antibody with biparatopic binding, JZP441, an orexin-2 receptor agonist, and JZP898, a differentiated, conditionally-activated interferon alpha (IFNα) INDUKINE™ molecule. We're very encouraged by the positive top-line results from the pivotal trial of zanidatamab in biliary tract cancers (BTC) and the first overall survival data for zanidatamab from the Phase 2 first-line (1L) metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) trial that was announced at ASCO GI," said Rob Iannone, M.D., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, global head of research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. "With the initiation of multiple clinical trials in 2022, we continue to expand our pipeline into disease areas with significant unmet patient need and market potential, including difficult-to-treat cancers and Parkinson's disease tremor, and we've rapidly progressed JZP441 since bringing it in-house to enable initial proof-of-concept in healthy volunteers in 2023. We enter 2023 with meaningfully increased investment in R&D, which coupled with our upcoming catalysts and expanded capabilities, gives us confidence in delivering sustainable long-term value." Key Highlights Business and Execution Xywav became the Company's largest product by net sales in 4Q22, annualizing at more than $1 billion as a result of continued adoption in both narcolepsy and IH. Achieved a significant milestone exiting October 2022, with more narcolepsy patients taking Xywav than Xyrem®. Expect Xywav to remain the oxybate of choice in 2023. Epidyolex® delivered compelling growth in 4Q22 and is now launched and reimbursed in all five key European markets: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. Received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Rylaze supplemental Biologics Licensing Application (sBLA) for Monday/Wednesday/Friday (MWF) intramuscular (IM) dosing. Strategic corporate development further expanded R&D pipeline with the addition of zanidatamab, a novel late-stage oncology asset. Positive top-line results from the pivotal trial of zanidatamab in BTC in December 2022 and the first overall survival data for zanidatamab from a Phase 2 trial in 1L HER2-expressing metastatic GEA in January 2023. Enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 trial for suvecaltamide (JZP385) in Parkinson's disease tremor in 4Q22. Financial Growing and durable commercial franchises drove 2022 total revenues of $3.7 billion; 18% increase compared to 2021. Successfully delevered balance sheet in 2022; exiting the year at 2.9x adjusted net leverage ratio1. Focus on disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence drove: Significantly increased cash from operations of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $779 million in 2021. Improved leverage of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which as a percentage of sales decreased significantly in 4Q22 and FY22 relative to the same periods in 2021. Ability to invest nearly $450 million in strategic transactions in 2022, while still achieving net leverage target. 2023 total revenue guidance of $3,675 to $3,875 million, 3% growth at the mid-point. Total revenue guidance is underpinned by expectations of continued growth in net sales of Xywav, Epidiolex/Epidyolex and the oncology portfolio, a continued decline in net sales of Xyrem and royalties on net sales of Authorized Generics of Xyrem.      1. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Non-GAAP net leverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Business Updates Key Commercial Products Oxybate (Xywav and Xyrem): Net product sales for the combined oxybate business increased 10% to $1,978.9 million in 2022 and increased 12% to $528.9 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. Average active oxybate patients on therapy was approximately 18,000 in 4Q22, an increase of 11% compared to the same period in 2021. Xywav (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution: Xywav net product sales increased 79% to $958.4 million in 2022 and increased 54% to $281.4 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. Xywav became the Company's largest product by net product sales in 4Q22, annualizing at more than $1 billion as a result of continued adoption in both narcolepsy and IH. There were approximately 10,300 active Xywav patients exiting 4Q22. Xywav for Narcolepsy: There were approximately 8,550 narcolepsy patients taking Xywav exiting 4Q22. Achieved another significant milestone exiting October 2022, with more narcolepsy patients taking Xywav than Xyrem. The benefits of lowering sodium intake continue to resonate with patients and prescribers. In June 2021, FDA recognized seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), through July 2027, for Xywav and published its summary of clinical superiority findings. Xywav for Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH): There were approximately 1,750 IH patients taking Xywav exiting 4Q22. The Company has achieved its goal of obtaining similar payer coverage to narcolepsy, with coverage now at approximately 90% of commercial lives for IH. The Company launched Xywav, the first and only treatment approved by FDA for IH, in November 2021. Initial launch efforts have focused on the approximately 37,000 currently diagnosed patients in the U.S. who are actively seeking healthcare. Healthcare providers are excited to have a treatment option with positive and compelling clinical trial results that addresses IH and not just its symptoms. FDA recognized ODE for IH in January 2022, extending regulatory exclusivity to August 2028. Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution: Xyrem net product sales decreased 19% to $1,020.5 million in 2022 and decreased 14% to $247.5 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting the continued adoption of Xywav by patients with narcolepsy. Epidiolex/Epidyolex (cannabidiol): Epidiolex/Epidyolex net product sales increased 12%, on a proforma basis, to $736.4 million in 2022 and increased 7% to $207.0 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. The Company successfully completed the pricing and reimbursement process and the commercial launch of Epidyolex in France in 4Q22. Epidyolex is now launched in all five key European markets: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. In 4Q22, the Company enrolled the first patient in a pivotal Phase 3 trial of Epidyolex for Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and tuberous sclerosis in Japan. Zepzelca® (lurbinectedin):  Zepzelca net product sales increased 9% to $269.9 million in 2022 and increased 11% to $72.0 million in 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021. The Company is pleased Zepzelca continues to be the treatment of choice in the second-line (2L) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) setting. Zepzelca development program highlights: The EMERGE-201 Phase 2 basket trial evaluating Zepzelca as monotherapy in select relapsed/refractory solid tumors is ongoing. Phase 3 trial in partnership with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) to evaluate 1L use of Zepzelca in combination with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), compared to Tecentriq alone, as maintenance therapy in patients with extensive-stage SCLC after induction chemotherapy is ongoing. The Company expects complete enrollment in the trial by the end of 2023. The Company's partner, PharmaMar, is conducting the Phase 3 confirmatory trial, LAGOON, in 2L SCLC. If positive, this trial could confirm the benefit of Zepzelca in the treatment of SCLC when patients progress following 1L treatment with a platinum-based regimen. Rylaze (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn): Rylaze net product sales were $281.7 million in 2022 compared to $85.6 million in 2021, following commercial launch in July 2021, and increased 25% to $81.0 million in 4Q22 compared to the same period in 2021. Strong demand for Rylaze in the first year of launch reflects the significant unmet patient need for a high-quality, reliable supply of Erwinia asparaginase for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In November 2022, the Company received FDA approval for a MWF IM dosing schedule for Rylaze. In May 2022, the Company completed the Marketing Authorization Application submission to European Medicines Agency for a MWF dosing schedule and IM and intravenous (IV) administration for JZP458 (approved as Rylaze in the U.S.) with potential for approval in 2023. The Company is also advancing the program for potential submission, approval and launch in Japan. In April 2022, the Company submitted an sBLA for IV administration. In February 2023, the Company received a complete response letter from FDA requesting additional clinical data on the IV administration of Rylaze. There is no impact on the approved product labeling for Rylaze IM administration. Corporate Development Zanidatamab Agreement1: On October 19, 2022, the Company and Zymeworks Inc. announced an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement1 and on December 21, 2022, Jazz and Zymeworks announced Jazz exercised its option to continue with the exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab in key markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Initial focus is in BTC and GEA with potential to transform the current standard of care in multiple HER2-expressing cancers. In December 2022, Zymeworks announced positive top-line data from the pivotal HERIZON-BTC-01 clinical trial investigating zanidatamab as monotherapy in patients with previously treated HER2-amplified and expressing BTC. Zanidatamab as monotherapy produced a confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 41.3% and median duration of response of 12.9 months in patients. In January 2023, the Company and Zymeworks announced the first overall survival data of 84% at 18 months from a Phase 2 trial of zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy in 1L patients with HER2-expressing metastatic GEA. The pivotal trial, HERIZON-GEA-01, evaluating zanidatamab in 1L GEA is ongoing and top-line data are expected in 2024.         1. Exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab across all indications in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia/Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks. Key Pipeline Highlights JZP150: JZP150, a selective fatty acid amide hydrolase, or FAAH, inhibitor, is in clinical development for the potential treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patient enrollment is ongoing and top-line data read-out is anticipated in late 2023. The Company received Fast Track Designation for JZP150 development in PTSD from FDA, underscoring the significant unmet medical needs of patients. Suvecaltamide (JZP385): Suvecaltamide, a highly selective modulator of T-type calcium channels, is in clinical development for the treatment of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease tremor. Patient enrollment is ongoing in the Phase 2b ET trial and top-line data read-out is anticipated in 1H24. In 4Q22, the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 2 trial in patients with Parkinson's disease tremor. JZP441: JZP441, is a potent, highly selective oral orexin-2 receptor agonist designed to activate orexin signaling with the potential to be applicable in the treatment of narcolepsy, IH and other sleep disorders. In 4Q22, the first participant was enrolled into the Phase 1 development program to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of JZP441 in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers. The Company expects initial proof of concept in healthy volunteers in 2023. JZP815: The Company enrolled the first patient in a Phase 1 trial evaluating JZP815 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with MAPK pathway alterations. The pan-RAF inhibitor program is part of a novel class of next-generation precision oncology therapies that has the potential to benefit cancer patients with high unmet needs in multiple different solid tumors. JZP898: JZP898 is an engineered IFNα cytokine pro-drug that is activated specifically within the tumor microenvironment where it can stimulate IFNα receptors on cancer-fighting immune effector cells. The aim is to minimize the severe toxicities that have been observed with systemically active recombinant IFNα therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Type 1 interferon signal transduction by IFNα agonism is a clinically validated mechanism of action, and IFNα has been shown to work synergistically in combination with other proven therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies and chemotherapy. This allows for potential application across a wide range of cancer types, combination regimens and lines of therapy. The Company expects to file an Investigational New Drug application for JZP898 in the U.S. this year.

The income tax benefit for 2022, also includes the tax impact of an impairment of acquired IPR&D related to nabiximols. The GAAP income tax expense for 2021, included an expense of $259.9 million related to the change in the statutory tax rate in the U.K.   Three Months Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31, (In thousands, except percentages) 2022  2021  2022  2021 Non-GAAP adjusted:        Cost of product sales $       93,386  $       58,110  $     251,941  $     205,401 Gross margin 90.3 %  93.5 %  93.1 %  93.3 % Selling, general and administrative $     319,763  $     328,656  $  1,134,703  $  1,105,048 % of total revenues 32.9 %  36.7 %  31.0 %  35.7 % Research and development $     160,105  $     140,101  $     521,085  $     451,026 % of total revenues 16.5 %  15.6 %  14.2 %  14.6 % Acquired in-process research and development $     375,000  $              —  $     444,148  $              — Income tax expense (benefit)(1) $      (43,301)  $       37,254  $       94,695  $     148,764 Effective tax rate(1) 92.6 %  12.3 %  9.1 %  13.0 %       1. The non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense (benefit), for 4Q22 and 2022, includes the tax impact of payments made for acquired IPR&D in those periods. Changes in operating expenses in 2022 and 4Q22 over the prior year periods are primarily due to the following: Cost of product sales increased in 2022 and 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, due to an expense for past royalties payable under a settlement agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. In addition, cost of product sales, on a GAAP basis, in 2022 included increased inventory fair value step-up expense of $50.3 million compared to 2021, driven by the inclusion of a full year expense. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, on a GAAP basis, decreased in 2022 and 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, due to lower GW acquisition related transaction and integration expenses and lower Sunosi® (solriamfetol) related costs, offset by restructuring costs and costs related to program terminations and increased investment in sales and marketing, primarily relating to Xywav and, for the full year period, the inclusion of GW related headcount costs for the full year and the loss on the disposal of Sunosi. SG&A expenses, on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the inclusion of GW related headcount costs for the full year and increased investment in sales and marketing, offset by lower Sunosi related costs. SG&A expenses, on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, decreased in 4Q22 compared to 4Q21 primarily due to lower Sunosi related costs, offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased in 2022 and 4Q22 compared to the same periods in 2021, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, primarily due to the addition of costs related to zanidatamab, JZP898 and JZP441, and increased costs for JZP150, offset by a reduction in costs related to JZP458 (Rylaze), following its approval. R&D costs also increased in 2022, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, due to increased compensation related expenses driven by the inclusion of GW related headcount costs for the full period. Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense in 4Q22, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, related to payments of $375.0 million to Zymeworks, in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2022, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, also included upfront payments of $50.0 million to Sumitomo in relation to our licensing agreement and $15.0 million to Werewolf, in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement. The impairment charge in 2022, on a GAAP basis, related to an acquired IPR&D asset impairment relating to the discontinuation of our nabiximols program. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $881.5 million, and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's long-term debt was $5.8 billion compared to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company had undrawn borrowing capacity under a revolving credit facility of $500 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated $1,272.0 million of cash from operations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Jazz Pharmaceuticals' financial results and guidance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses certain non-GAAP (also referred to as adjusted or non-GAAP adjusted) financial measures in this press release and the accompanying tables. In particular, the Company presents non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (and the related per share measure) and its line item components, as well as certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures derived therefrom, including non-GAAP adjusted gross margin percentage and non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (and the related per share measure) and its line item components exclude from GAAP reported net loss (and the related per share measure) and its line item components certain items, as detailed in the reconciliation tables that follow, and in the case of non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (and the related per share measure), adjust for the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments and the impact of the change in the statutory tax rate in the U.K. In this regard, the components of non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss), including non-GAAP adjusted cost of product sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) measure. The Company also uses a non-GAAP net leverage ratio calculated as net debt (defined as total GAAP debt, net of cash and cash equivalents) divided by non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the most recent period of four consecutive completed fiscal quarters. EBITDA is defined as net loss before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain other charges and adjustments as detailed in the non-GAAP net leverage ratio reconciliation table that follows and is calculated in accordance with the definition of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA as set out in the Company's credit agreement entered into in May 2021 (the Credit Agreement). The Company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors and analysts and that each of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors' and analysts' ability to meaningfully compare the Company's results from period to period and to its forward-looking guidance, to identify operating trends in the Company's business and to understand the Company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are regularly used by investors and analysts to model and track the Company's financial performance. Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management also regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company's business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part on certain of these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures are important internal measurements for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management, the Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts since these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the Company uses in assessing its own operating performance and making operating decisions. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles in the reconciliation tables that follow. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company has ceased, and may in the future cease, to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the Company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in this press release and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

To do this, we conduct clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of investigational medicines, and the data generated from these trials allows us to obtain the necessary approvals from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which allow for broad access to medicines. At Jazz, we believe that wherever possible, use of an investigational medicine for a patient as part of a clinical trial is preferable because clinical trials can generate data that may lead to the approval of products and, consequently, to wider availability. Conducting clinical trials is extremely complex and challenging. The ultimate goal is the rigorous testing of the clinical product with the aim of securing regulatory approval and enabling the medicine to be available to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. Jazz complies with good clinical practices and takes steps to help ensure the quality and integrity of our clinical trials and to minimize risks to current research participants and future patients. For a list of clinical trials currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov. However, we also recognize that in some extreme circumstances, when participating in a clinical trial is not possible, patients facing serious or life-threatening conditions may seek special access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial setting. Consistent with applicable laws and regulations, Jazz may provide patients with access to investigational medicines through Expanded/Early Access Programs (EAPs) when there is sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the investigational medicine to support its use in the particular circumstance. It is important to note that terminology used can vary from country to country and dependent on the way that the medicine is accessed. Although often referred to as Expanded Access Programs or Early Access Programs, these types of access can also be known as Compassionate Use, Pre-approval Access, Named Patient Access and Emergency Use. EAPs do not apply to the use of a currently marketed medicine for an indication outside of the approved label. Types of Early Access Programs In general, there are two ways that Jazz can grant Early Access to an investigational medicine. The type of program available may be dependent on local laws and regulations. It is important to note that terminology used can vary from country to country and in some instances different countries use identical terminology to describe different approaches. Individual Patient Access – where a qualified healthcare professional requests an investigational medicine for use for a single patient because, in their judgement, currently available therapies are not satisfactory. This request may or may not require approval by the national health authority dependent on local regulation. Jazz may also make an investigational medicine available on a named, single patient basis through a third party provider in some territories. Multiple Patient Access – This type of program is commonly referred to as Compassionate Use in EU or Expanded Access in the United States and describes the process by which an investigational medicine is made available to a defined group of patients with an unmet medical need under a specific treatment protocol. In most countries this type of program is initiated by Jazz and approved by the national health authority. Individual Patient Access Multiple Patient Access Eligibility Criteria Jazz considers many factors when evaluating a request for individual patient access, also known as named patient access in Europe, to an investigational medicine, such as the strength of the clinical data, the benefit-risk profile, the potential impact on the clinical development program, the phase of development, the country-specific regulations, and probability and timing of regulatory approval within the applicant’s country, though the medicine may be approved in another country. In determining whether named patient access is appropriate outside of a clinical trial, the criteria Jazz evaluates include the following: Jazz has sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the investigational medicine to support its use in the particular circumstance. The disease is serious or life threatening. There are no beneficial available alternative treatments or patients have exhausted all other therapies. A clinical study is not available, either because patients are ineligible or because they have no access to the trial. The efficacy and safety data available at the time are of sufficient strength to determine whether the benefit to patient would likely outweigh the potential risks. Access is compliant with local rules and laws. The request must be made by the patient’s treating physician, unsolicited by Jazz Pharmaceuticals or any other individual or organization. The patient’s treating physician determined that there are sufficient safety and efficacy data, including dosing information, to support the use of the investigational medicine, that there is no comparable or satisfactory therapy available to treat the patient’s disease and that the probable risk to the patient from the investigational medicine is not greater than the probable risk from the disease itself. Jazz will consider the evaluation criteria in determining whether to offer individual patient access; however, Jazz cannot make a guarantee that named patient access will be available, and, even if a named access program is offered, Jazz cannot make a guarantee that the investigational medicine will be available to a particular patient. Decisions regarding potential named patient access to investigational medicines can only be made, in certain circumstances, after in-depth discussion between Jazz’s clinical teams and the patient’s qualified healthcare professional and in line with required national health authority approval, if applicable. Jazz is committed to a fair and impartial evaluation of each request for access to our investigational medicines. Therefore, all decisions are based on clinical circumstances. Whenever possible, patients will be referred to ongoing clinical trials as the primary way to access investigational medicines.
