Search Hamburger Guide to Clinical Trials for Children Participating in a clinical trial is an important and personal decision—especially when it’s with a child. We’re committed to improving the health and well-being of children around the world through thoughtfully designed clinical trials that give special consideration to our children participants and their needs. Home Science Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Children Why Participate in a Children’s Clinical Trial If you’re considering a clinical trial for a child, it may be helpful to understand why we run these trials in the first place. Sometimes it’s because certain conditions are especially common in children. More generally, it’s because children need treatments studied specifically for them. Their bodies are still developing, and the medicines and vaccines used to treat adults may not affect children in the same way that they affect adults. A pediatric clinical trial could help us develop the correct dose of a medicine or vaccine for a child, or it could focus on development of a liquid formulation that is easier to swallow. Participation from children in clinical trials helps us develop medicines and vaccines that are safe and effective for children. Leadership in Pediatric Research Every stage in a child’s development is unique, just as every child is special. In 2014, Pfizer formed the Pediatric Center of Excellence in order to better understand and meet the unique needs of children who are participating in clinical trials. We’re proud to partner with over 160 children’s hospitals and research centers chosen for their excellence and personal dedication to pediatric patients. This team combines the expertise and guidance of experienced pediatric physicians and researchers, child health advocates, parents, caregivers, and pediatric patients themselves. Today, those insights are at work in over 100 active or planned pediatric clinical studies as we continue to strive toward developing breakthroughs that change patients’ lives.

Search Hamburger Diversity in Our Clinical Trials Race, ethnicity, age, and sex can all impact how different people respond to the same medicine or vaccine. This is why diversity among clinical trial participants is so important. The more diverse a group of clinical trial participants is, the more we can learn about the safety and efficacy of a potential medicine or vaccine for people now and in the future. Home Science Clinical Trials Diversity Historically Underrepresented Historically, some communities have been underrepresented as participants in clinical research. There are barriers that exist to clinical trial participation, including geographic access, language barriers, limited awareness and communication of research options, cost or insurance concerns, and lack of trust in the medical community and drug development process due to discrimination and mistreatment of ethnically diverse groups in clinical research in the past. In fact, Black Americans account for roughly 13 percent of the U.S. population but make up only 5 percent of clinical trial participants. Hispanic and Latino participants account for roughly 19 percent of the population in the U.S. but make up only 1 percent of clinical trial participants.* Historic mistreatment and human rights violations in research throughout the world have resulted in changes in the law to ensure that clinical trials are conducted ethically and participants come first. Today, all clinical trials must follow Good Clinical Practice, an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing and conducting clinical trials. As part of Good Clinical Practice, institutional review boards (IRBs) or independent ethics committees (IECs) oversee clinical trials, with a focus on protecting the rights, safety, and well-being of participants. An IRB or IEC is an independent group that: includes scientists, doctors, and lay people. reviews a clinical trial’s design and any updates to it, as well as any information provided to participants. has the authority to approve, ask for changes, or not approve a clinical research study. To gain an understanding on the disparity of minority representation in our own studies, we published a landmark, 10-year retrospective analysis (taking data from 2011–2020) of the ethnic, racial, age, and gender diversity in our clinical trials. This study serves as an important industry benchmark and baseline from which to measure our future progress in advancing health equity. At Pfizer, we are committed to creating change for the better by doing our part to make a more inclusive future for clinical research and by building trusted relationships within diverse communities. Ensuring diversity in clinical trials is a matter of equity. We’ve made a commitment to design clinical trials so that enrollment can reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the countries where we conduct clinical trials and the epidemiology of the diseases we intend to treat or prevent. Pfizer is committed to addressing both informational and practical barriers to clinical trial participation. That’s why we’re taking the following steps toward meeting this goal: Embedding the importance of diversity in clinical trials into our company’s culture Evolving how we partner with clinical trial sites by choosing locations in communities that represent a diverse pool of potential participants Working with patient advocacy organizations, media the community to raise awareness, build trust, and work to removing barriers to participating in trials Making it easier for patients to find information about potential trials by providing culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate materials in multiple languages Embracing digital tools that can reduce the burden on volunteers by introducing flexibility in trial design and participation Let’s Undo Underrepresentation Pfizer Undo Underrepresented 30s Black 16x9 New Logo No Slate Share Play Video When individuals choose to participate in a clinical trial, they will represent people like themselves and from their local communities — in age, race, ethnicity, and gender. The choice to participate in a clinical trial is a personal one and should be made in consultation with your doctor and your support network, including family and friends.

The information below explains options that may be available to patients in these circumstances. 1. Clinical Trials For new medicines and vaccines to be legally approved for use, companies like Pfizer are required to evaluate their safety and effectiveness in clinical trials and submit trial results to regulatory agencies. To participate in a trial, you must meet certain criteria. For those who meet the criteria to join a clinical trial, participation offers the chance to contribute to medical research that may benefit many others. Participation in a clinical trial comes with certain risks; that is why patient “informed consent” is a required step in the process of enrolling.

Expanded Access or Compassionate Use In cases where a clinical trial isn’t an option, and the patient has exhausted all available treatment options, regulators/health authorities may grant permission for us to provide a treating physician with an investigational drug pre-approval. Such individual use of an investigational drug pre-approval is often called "expanded access" or “compassionate use” but may go by other names. Pfizer refers to these requests as expanded access.

Search Hamburger Rare Disease: Pioneering Breakthroughs While referred to as “rare” due to the smaller size of individual patient populations, rare diseases are collectively common and their burden on society is staggering. We aspire to be the world’s leading innovator in rare disease by pioneering science that has a profound impact on the lives of underserved patient populations. Home Science Areas of Focus Rare Disease There are over 7,000 known rare diseases that affect approximately 400 million people worldwide. 80% of these diseases have genetic origins and 50% affect children. Collectively, people living with a rare disease represent one of the largest underserved patient communities in the world, with only 5% of known rare diseases having one or more approved treatments. At Pfizer, we believe that people living with a rare disease, along with the untold number of family members and caregivers who support them, deserve more.

Search Hamburger Internal Medicine: Innovating to Impact Millions Cardiovascular (heart) and metabolic diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide. We’re committed to addressing these global health challenges by developing potential therapies to treat or prevent disease progression and improve the quality of life for patients. Home Science Areas of Focus Internal Medicine Disease Education Information Despite fewer people smoking and effective therapies for hypertension and high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death worldwide.1 This epidemic is driven by demographic factors like an aging population, decreasing mortality from other factors (such as infectious disease), and rising rates of obesity—which can drive the progression of metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, and lead to the “metabolic syndrome,” a constellation of risk factors that increase an individual’s risk for heart disease and other health problems.2-6 We believe that a comprehensive program is needed to address cardiometabolic disease and the underlying biology responsible for its onset and progression. Today, we’re focused on investigating the metabolic abnormalities that increase the likelihood of cardiometabolic diseases; working to develop potential therapies for these diseases, which are driven by an abnormal metabolic state; and seeking ways to protect the heart itself, by trying to alter the way it responds to this dysregulated metabolic environment. This includes more potential therapies targeted to specific metabolic pathways in the body, as well as therapies that are a combination of two or more drugs, which could bring additional benefits to patients. Our early discovery efforts are focused on obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and metabolic conditions such as cachexia, a form of unintentional weight loss and muscle-wasting often experienced with cancer and other serious illnesses.

Search Hamburger Inflammation & Immunology: Root Causes Many patients with chronic inflammatory diseases have access to therapies that only relieve their symptoms. We believe we can address the root cause of these debilitating diseases by treating it at the molecular level. Home Our Science: Pharmaceutical Development | Pfizer Disease Education Information: Inflammation Inflammation is a critical response to potential danger signals and damage to organs in our body. But with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and many others, our own immune system turns against our organs. These painful and debilitating conditions take an immense toll on people’s quality of life and many of these diseases are poorly managed by existing treatments that provide only symptomatic relief. For decades, doctors relied on steroids to suppress immune response. Though an important option, steroids come with many potentially harmful side effects. Fortunately, science has continued to advance, and today we have the opportunity to transform the management of inflammatory diseases with new classes of therapies that target other key proteins and pathways in the body.

Search Hamburger Vaccines: Using Natural Immunity The best time to stop a virus or bacterium is before it can infect someone. Vaccines can give your body way to identify an infecting agent, and instructions on how to defeat it—and potentially, avoid infecting others.  Home Our Science: Pharmaceutical Development | Pfizer Vaccine Education Information The human body is constantly dealing with invaders. Most of the time they’re detected and destroyed before they can do any harm.  But there are times when it’s not a fair fight.  Throughout our history, viruses like smallpox and influenza have killed hundreds of millions of people. So when it was discovered that the body could be armed ahead of time to fight the invader by inoculation with a vaccine,it was hailed as a breakthrough.  Since then, vaccines have repeatedly confirmed their place as one of the greatest public health advancements of all time. And their widespread use has resulted in the control, elimination, or near-elimination of many infectious diseases that were once pervasive and often fatal.   At Pfizer, we have a long history in vaccine research and development, including a pivotal role in the eradication of polio and smallpox. Through the development of innovative delivery systems and technologies (the term often used is “novel vaccines”), we’ve created innovations for preventing deadly bacterial infections like those caused by S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis.  Today, more than at any time in history, people are benefiting from safe and effective vaccines to prevent infections and diseases. These injections have protected people of all ages, from newborns to seniors.  However, our work is not done. Many viruses and bacteria still present a serious health risk, and so we continue to focus on research and development in new areas, with the goal of adding more approved vaccines to tackle pathogens. Prevention is the Best Medicine When a patient has a serious infection, they may be treated with antibiotic or antiviral drugs that aid their body in fighting the pathogen. While these medicines can be effective, fighting an infection once it’s advanced and the patient is hospitalized is not as easy as as preventing it in the first place.  Vaccines work by preparing the body’s immune system with a defense against the pathogen. The virus or bacterium is recognized, neutralized, and destroyed, often before it can spread.  Our Vaccine Research and Development scientists are working to extend the benefits of vaccines into new areas. They are ushering in a new era of innovation for the prevention of disease, with a special focus on researching and developing vaccines for special populations such as maternal/neonatal, and vaccines intended to address hospital-acquired infections, and cancer.  Vaccines: Protection for All Age Groups To help protect as many people as possible from life-threatening illness, we’re working to develop and distribute vaccines throughout the world. We’ve already seen that by channeling resources to the most promising public health opportunities, we can have an impact across all areas of life. Focus Areas: Vaccines Our Vaccine Research & Development program includes an ongoing focus on the prevention of pneumococcal disease.

Search Hamburger The Potential of Precision Medicine Precision medicine investigates the biological basis of diseases, utilizing emerging technologies to support the development of innovative therapies tailored to the patients who will benefit most. In our portfolio, we’re focused on exploring genetic, phenotypic, and functional biomarkers to help guide clinical research strategies. Our goal is to develop medicines and vaccines with potentially transformational outcomes for patients by treating the right patients with the right medicines – an approach that’s embedded in the development of every product in our portfolio. Home Science Areas of Innovation Precision Medicine Biomarkers Precision medicine relies on the use of biological indicators called biomarkers to classify patients by their risk for certain diseases and/or response to treatment and to precisely characterize their genotype, or genetic code, and phenotype, or physical traits. Genetics The emergence of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized the use of human genetics for pharmaceutical R&D by providing the ability to conduct a deeper analysis of genotype in the context of detailed phenotypes. This has generated unprecedented insight into the genetics of human disease and a wealth of novel drug targets and biomarkers. Deep Phenotyping Technologies Phenotyping technologies allow better understanding of human physiology and disease in unprecedented detail, for identifying and validating better biomarkers and response to treatment. These include high throughput omics technologies (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), microbiome profiling, flow cytometry, and electronic biomarkers such as actigraphy (i.e., the measurement of patient movement in real time using mobile sensors). Digital Precision Medicine Digital biomarkers are gaining increasing importance as an approach to defining more precise outcome measures and clinical research endpoints. These can include, for example, cognitive tests in the form of games on tablets, mood and disease progression by voice recording, and actigraphy, among other measures. Health Information Technology Health information technology platforms refer to systems that help collect, store, and analyze vast amounts of health data with a particular focus on correlating phenotypic and genotypic information (sometimes referred to as “big data”), which are becoming more readily available to the research community.

Search Hamburger Harnessing the Potential of mRNA The swift delivery of the world’s first mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine put a big spotlight on the promise of mRNA technology, but we think the scientific community is only beginning to tap its potential. The next wave of scientific innovation is upon us, and Pfizer is working hard to harness the power of mRNA. Our expertise in disease biology, along with our robust, rapid manufacturing capabilities, and talented scientific minds will help propel the potential of this technology forward. Home Science Areas of Innovation mRNA Technology Unleashing the Next Wave of Scientific Innovations to Fight Viruses and More What is mRNA? mRNA—or messenger RNA—is a molecule that contains the instructions or recipe that directs the cells to make a protein using its natural machinery. To enter cells smoothly, mRNA travels within a protective bubble called a Lipid Nanoparticle. Once inside, our cells read the mRNA as a set of instructions, building proteins that match up with parts of the pathogen called antigens. The immune system sees these foreign antigens as invaders—dispatching defenders called antibodies and T-cells—and training the immune system for potential future attacks. So, if and when the real virus comes along, the body might recognize it—sounding the alarm to help defend against infection and illness. The Potential of mRNA to Deliver New Vaccines and Treatments Though many people first became aware of mRNA technology because of COVID-19 vaccines, it is not new to the scientific community. For decades, scientists have studied mRNA, looking for ways to unlock its potential to prevent and treat disease. While the mechanism of action for mRNA technology is relatively simple—once inside cells, it instructs them to build proteins—researchers have had to work for years develop technologies to allow mRNA to work in the real world. mRNA has proved to be a great platform for vaccine development (and potentially therapeutics), so that our own cells can do the hard work of producing proteins, resulting in an immune response which helps protect us against diseases. The approval of the first mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines was a scientific turning point, establishing mRNA as a versatile, flexible technology. The focus and drive Pfizer gave to developing our COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with BioNTech gave us a wealth of scientific knowledge in just one year. Pfizer’s next wave of mRNA scientific innovation is expanding in the infectious disease arena with development programs in flu(link is external) (influenza) and shingles, also exploring its versatility in the areas of rare genetic diseases. We will stay close to other opportunities where the scientific rationale for using mRNA is strongest and Pfizer’s disease and biology area expertise is deepest, where the potential impact on patients could be greatest. Partnering and Collaboration to Advance mRNA Science To further build our internal capabilities, collaboration and partnership are key elements of Pfizer’s mRNA strategy. A variety of licensing and research collaborations have been initiated to further the development of mRNA-based vaccines and treatment options, including: An ongoing collaboration with BioNTech to advance candidates including COVID-19 and shingles. Pfizer and BioNTech also have a collaboration on flu that was initiated in 2018. A Development and Option agreement with Acuitas Therapeutics, which will provide an option to license Acuitas’ lipid nanoparticle delivery system for up to 10 targets for vaccine or therapeutic development.

Their complexity enables them to be used to treat a variety of conditions for which no other treatments are available.  Home Our Pfizer Products Hold the Cure Why Are Biologics Important? While most drugs have a known structure and so can be chemically synthesized, biologics are derived from existing natural systems. This gives them a larger, more complex structure. As a result, the treatments derived from them are more challenging to produce. But the effort has paid off. Biologics are helping to advance patient care by delivering highly effective and targeted treatment across multiple life-threatening and chronic diseases—for conditions where patients have had few effective options. Approved by the FDA, biologics are now used in the fields of oncology, inflammation and immunology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, diabetes, neurology, and inherited conditions. What Is a Biosimilar? Biosimilars are medicines specifically designed to have similar properties to a drug that’s already been created and licensed. Since biosimilars are never exact copies of the medicine they’re designed to imitate, their safety and effectiveness must be independently established. Regulatory guidance for biosimilars has been developed in Europe, the United States, and many countries throughout the world. To meet these standards scientists gather widespread evidence, work together with limited nonclinical studies, and collect detailed comparative human pharmacokinetics and efficacy in a relevant patient population. This “totality of evidence” helps ensure that patients receive quality products that are both safe and effective.

Taking care of our health is a part of life, not just when we visit a clinic or hospital. Health literacy can help us protect our health, understand health problems, and perhaps avoid or manage some of them.1 What is health literacy? Health literacy is a measure of how patients get health information and services, understand them, and use them. Health literacy is different from literacy, which is a person’s reading and writing skills. Health literacy also includes math skills and knowledge of health topics and the human body.5 Health literacy depends on individual factors as well as the healthcare system. Medical or technical words may be unfamiliar, but patients can continue to learn new terms and health topics. By improving health literacy, patients may be able to make better choices about their health.2 Improving Health Literacy Health information can feel difficult and confusing. What people learn about health information may be incomplete and often becomes outdated.7 Nearly 9 out of 10 adults may not have received the health literacy tools needed to manage their health. Improving Health Literacy May Help Patients: Improve health outcomes and quality of care and lower healthcare costs. Find a healthcare provider, like a primary care doctor, specialist, or a service, like a mammogram or an X-ray. Fill out complicated medical forms. Share information with the healthcare team. Understand treatment options and their benefits and risks. Work with other members of the healthcare team to decide on a treatment plan. Manage treatment options, set goals, and ask questions  Improving health literacy is the job of the entire healthcare team. What can you, the patient, do to improve your health literacy? 11  When you visit your healthcare provider, start with these three simple questions 12, 13 What is my main health problem? What do I need to do? Why is it important for me to do this? Don’t be afraid to ask your healthcare professionals to explain something again.

That’s why we have an aggressive campaign to fight counterfeit Pfizer medicines. Pfizer’s Role In Combatting Fake Medicine According to the Pharmaceutical Security Institute(link is external), officials uncovered 4,344 incidents of counterfeiting, illegal diversion and theft of pharmaceuticals in 137 countries in 2020. The crimes involved more than 2,451 different medicines across every therapeutic category. The PSI documented 2,574 arrests for pharmaceutical crime in 2020, the largest number of arrests achieved in 19 years of data.  To assist law enforcement agencies to prevent counterfeit Pfizer medicines from reaching patients, Pfizer Global Security have provided product training to authorities from 164 countries. Interpol Operation Pangea XV(link is external) in 2022 involved police, customs and health regulatory authorities from 94 countries. It resulted in $11m in illicit medicines seized, 200 search warrants issued and more than 4,000 web links including websites and online marketplaces containing adverts for illicit products being closed or removed. We have an aggressive campaign to fight counterfeit Pfizer medicines. DETECT DISRUPT DETER IMPACT Take action to make counterfeit medicines more difficult for criminals to produce and easier to identify. The Risks of Buying Medicine Online Fight the Fakes Fight the Fakes is a campaign that aims to raise awareness about the dangers of fake medicines by telling the stories of those who have been personally impacted and of those working to put a stop to this threat to public health. It also outlines opportunities for action by organizations and individuals who are looking to support this effort. Share Your Story The Startling Reality Counterfeit medicine is fake medicine, and they are a threat to the health and safety of patients around the world. Counterfeit medicines are dangerous by their very nature – they are not produced under safe manufacturing conditions and they are not inspected by regulatory authorities. It is impossible to know what ingredients counterfeit medicines contain. Sophisticated counterfeiters will put some of the active ingredient in the fake medicine and make it look very similar to the real medicine. The primary danger in taking a counterfeit medicine is that you are putting something into your body that not only may not help your current condition, but more alarmingly could result in harmful effects to your overall health.  No country or product is immune to the threat of counterfeit. Even in countries generally considered "safe," such as Canada, the United States, and many in the European Union, counterfeit medicines have entered the supply chain. The types of counterfeit medicines offered for sale without a prescription include, but are not limited to, lifesaving medicines such as those to treat cancer, bacterial infection antibiotics, diabetes, and anti-inflammatory medicines. Reputable online pharmacies will ask for a prescription issued by a relevant healthcare professional and provide adequate warnings about the possible side effects of the drug.   Pfizer’s Anti-Counterfeiting Program It is precisely because of the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to patients that Pfizer has implemented an aggressive and focused campaign to detect, disrupt and deter major manufacturers and distributors of counterfeit Pfizer medicines. We work with wholesalers, pharmacies, customs offices, and law enforcement agencies worldwide to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels, and improve surveillance of distributors and re-packagers. Most significantly, we conduct and manage pro-active investigations and refer the cases we develop to enforcement authorities. Our investigations are initiated in response to “leads” from a variety of sources, including complaints from patients and healthcare professionals, observations by members of our sales force, information concerning changes in sales volume and patterns from confidential informants and intelligence from enforcement authorities.

Search Hamburger Home Science Coronavirus Resources COVID-19: Prevention and Treatment Options COVID-19: Prevention and Treatment Options Vaccination and treatment for eligible patients: a two-pronged approach for COVID-19 From the beginning, we understood that fighting COVID-19 would require the power of science and unprecedented collaboration among scientists, companies, governments, and other stakeholders around the world. We know that vaccinations have played an important role in public health by helping to protect us from serious diseases and helping to reduce the burden of once common infections. While primary series vaccinations and boosters remain one of the first lines of defense to help protect people against COVID-19, for those who do test positive for COVID-19, there are now authorized oral treatment options available for appropriate patients who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Since 2020, we have been working on a two-pronged approach focused on prevention through primary series vaccination and booster shots, and through oral treatment. There is still more work to be done, though. At Pfizer, we remain unwavering in our commitment to combatting COVID-19. Prevention through vaccination Prevention through getting eligible people to complete a primary series of vaccination and booster shots remains critical to help in the fight against COVID-19. That’s why, in 2020, we set out to make the impossible possible. In collaboration with BioNTech, we delivered a breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine to the world in record time. We developed our COVID-19 vaccine using mRNA, or messenger RNA. Prior to that, no mRNA vaccine had ever been authorized or approved and, thus, one had never been manufactured at scale by any company. We worked with tremendous urgency, without compromising quality, coordinating closely with trial participants and investigators, regulatory bodies, other companies, and governments to bring this vaccine forward. Our success was made possible in part due to Pfizer’s longstanding history in vaccine research, development, and delivery, which dates back more than a century. Today, while clinical and real-world data still show that existing COVID-19 vaccine options can help protect against the virus, we are continuing to follow the science and exploring new vaccine approaches that may be needed as the pandemic evolves. In the meantime, we believe that the best safeguard against the spread of COVID-19 is getting all eligible people up to date with their vaccination schedule. Oral treatment for appropriate high-risk patients who test positive for COVID-19 In early 2020, recognizing the urgency and escalation of COVID-19 across the globe, we assembled a committed, multidisciplinary team and initiated a clinical program to develop an oral treatment, specifically designed to help inhibit the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus). Pfizer researchers identified our most promising candidate —a protease inhibitor— to progress into clinical studies and, ultimately, received the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an oral COVID-19 treatment. Since then, it has been approved or authorized for conditional or emergency use by many regulatory authorities around the world.  Manufacturing and access to COVID-19 vaccine and treatment Since 2020, we have continued to scale up our at-risk manufacturing efforts to expand vaccine and treatment access to different populations, based on local authorization or approval. As of July 3, 2022, more than 3.6 billion Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines were shipped to 180 countries in every region of the world. And, in anticipation of the potential for regulatory authorization or approval, Pfizer initiated early, at risk manufacturing of our oral treatment; by the end of June 2022, we had shipped more than 23.3 million courses of our oral treatment to 40 countries around the world. We remain committed to working toward equitable access to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment for people around the world at an affordable price and are working with governments and other appropriate partners on a tailored approach. Why do we need both COVID-19 vaccine options and oral treatments? If I’m vaccinated and have COVID-19, can I take an oral treatment? Why should I get vaccinated if I can just take an oral treatment option if I test positive for COVID-19? Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine while taking the COVID-19 oral treatment? Can we end the pandemic with both COVID-19 vaccine and treatment options?

Search Hamburger Home Science Coronavirus Resources Treatment Efforts COVID-19 Treatment Efforts Advancing A Novel SARS-CoV-2 Treatment The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on patients, families, and communities around the globe. At Pfizer, we believe multiple public health tools – including vaccines and treatments – will be critical to efforts to combat the virus and protect lives. In early 2020, recognizing the urgency of the situation, we initiated a drug design and development program – which originated and advanced in our labs – to develop a potentially safe and effective oral treatment that could complement vaccination efforts and help prevent severe illness. We assembled a committed, multidisciplinary team with the goal of delivering a novel therapeutic compound that could be administered orally, maintain potent activity against SARS-CoV-2, and have the potential to be effective against other coronaviruses. Using state-of-the-art computational and structure-based design capabilities, combined with our legacy in developing oral therapeutics, Pfizer researchers identified a promising pre-clinical candidate – which is a main protease, or Mpro, inhibitor – which we progressed into the clinic and, ultimately, to regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization. Developing potential COVID-19 treatments is only possible through the dedicated work of our scientific collaborators, clinical research partners, and individuals who volunteer to take part in clinical trials. We are grateful to all those who are partnering with us in this effort and to all the participants who have volunteered, and will volunteer, to help attempt to achieve our shared goal of making a difference for society.
