We have a very robust quality and safety training process (initial and continuous training) for our associates and we are regularly audited on our training procedures. Examples of topics covered in training for all employees include: product quality reporting (adverse events), information management and responsible record keeping, Novartis Group quality management escalation and GxP on-boarding.  We require all employees involved in manufacturing, supply and distribution to undergo at least two annual trainings on quality standards. Employees can also take additional training relevant to their specific role or worksite.  All associates in Novartis Technical Operations (manufacturing arm of Novartis) complete their initial role-specific training to ensure they can safely and compliantly perform their tasks, prior to performing them independently. All Novartis employees (including contractors) in manufacturing and quality assurance are continuously trained to maintain the skills and knowledge needed to manufacture medicine safely, compliantly and effectively. Examples of these trainings include: aseptic operator, enhanced third-party oversight, data integrity, investigation certification program and quality management systems.  All third parties providing materials, products or services to GxP standards are required by regulation to have their own quality assurance department and a formal training process. Novartis routinely assesses the capability and effectiveness of third-party training programs during audits, to confirm suitability of the provided service or product.

Before these therapies can be approved and commercially available to patients, they must undergo clinical trials to evaluate their safety and effectiveness. While it is generally preferred that patients gain access to investigational therapies by participating in clinical trials, patients may not be eligible or able to take part in these studies. Patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions sometimes seek therapies that are not yet approved or available in their country. The Novartis Gene Therapies "Managed Access Program" addresses this need by making certain investigational or unapproved therapies available to eligible patients. Clinical Trials Before an investigational therapy can be placed on the market, it must undergo well-controlled clinical trials to evaluate its safety and effectiveness, as well understand whether its potential benefit to patients outweighs the possible risks. More About Clinical Trials Managed Access Program The Novartis Gene Therapies global Managed Access Program (MAP) is designed to provide a potential pathway for patients seeking such a treatment, provided the required eligibility criteria are met and in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The Novartis Gene Therapies “Managed Access” terminology covers all locally defined pre-approval access mechanisms and programs such as “Compassionate Use”, “Expanded Access”, “Named Patient Supply”, “Special Access Schemes/Programs”, and others. Current Novartis Gene Therapies “Managed Access Program”: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Managed Access Program. This global Managed Access Program is available to eligible patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in countries where Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) treatment has not received regulatory approval or formal access approval. For this global MAP, the physician will need to assess patient eligibility by determining whether the patient meets pre-defined medical and program-specific criteria. To participate in the global MAP, patients must meet all eligibility criteria outlined in the treatment plan, including but not limited to: Patients under the age of two with genetically confirmed bi-allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene; regardless of type, copy number, or symptom onset. Geographically, the patient must be a citizen or legal resident of, and eligible for healthcare in, a country where Zolgensma has not received regulatory approval or formal access approval. Implementation of the program will need to comply with the specific legal and regulatory framework that applies in every country. Medical eligibility needs to be confirmed and Health Authority approval obtained in the country where the patient will be treated. In situations where the number of requests outweigh available supply, a third-party administers a blinded allocation. If Novartis Gene Therapies is not able to provide our treatment to the patient at that time, the patient automatically rolls over to the pool for the next allocation as long as he/she remains medically eligible and it is still permissible in the country. Our one-time gene therapy is provided free-of-charge. To ensure safe administration and adequate follow-up, treatment can only be administered in trained treatment centers. If no such center exists in the patient’s country of residence, Novartis Gene Therapies determines the feasibility of alternative treatment center locations. More About Novartis Managed Access Who should I contact for more information? For general medical information queries, healthcare professionals may submit requests to the Novartis Gene Therapies Medical Information team in the US, Europe, Middle East and Asia, Latin America & Canada, or Asia-Pacific. How do I submit a request for Managed Access? A request must be submitted by the treating physician on behalf of the patient. Requests can be submitted via Novartis Gene Therapies request portal here(link is external). Guidance on using the portal is also available. Patients/parents/caregivers should contact their treating physician and ask him/her about this global MAP.

Our work is powered by a toolkit of five R&D approaches – two established platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics) plus three advanced platforms (xRNA, radioligand therapy and gene and cell therapy) that will play an increasingly important role in making new medicines. Chemistry The discovery of low weight synthetic molecules that can be optimized as medicines. Biotherapeutics (biologics) Medicines derived from molecules of life, carefully engineered to treat specific diseases. xRNA Therapies designed to block the production of disease-related proteins by targeting RNA. Radioligand Therapy A precision approach to delivering radiation directly to tumor cells while only minimally affecting surrounding healthy cells – almost like “a guided missile” to cancer cells. Gene and cell therapy Gene therapies modify part of a patient’s genes to help treat diseases, while cell therapy restores or alters certain cells or uses cells to carry a therapy in the body.

RLT is a form of precision nuclear medicine that may recognize and treat disease. It is 1 of 4 major treatment approaches we are pursuing for cancer: targeted therapy, RLT, cell therapy, gene therapy and immunology.     Radioligand therapy explained By harnessing the power of radioactive atoms and applying it to advanced cancers through radioligand therapy, RLTs are able to deliver radiation to target cells anywhere in the body. The goal of the targeted approach is to limit the damage to surrounding tissues.     A “See It, Treat It” approach Nuclear medicine has both diagnostic imaging and therapeutic components, which we call radioligand imaging and radioligand therapy. Both use the same targeting approach. The diagnostic imaging component delivers radioactive atoms that have the potential to reveal tumor locations, while the therapeutic component delivers radioactive particles that have the potential to damage cells.     The history of nuclear medicine Scientists first discovered and identified radioactive atoms in the late 1800s. They found that certain natural elements emit invisible rays of energy. They called this energy “radiation” and later applied it to imaging and treating cancer. It would take scientists decades to understand how to apply the energy that emerges from these special atoms. Learn more How is radioligand therapy developed? Radioligand therapies have 2 primary components: the radioisotope and the cell-targeting compound, or ligand. Therapeutic radioisotopes are produced in special nuclear reactors or generators, then shipped to a production facility where the radioisotope is bonded to the cell- targeting compound. The finished product is then placed in vials, sent through quality testing, packaged into special lead-shielded containers, and shipped directly to the hospital or clinic as a ready-to-use therapy. The activity of the radioisotope diminishes over a specific period of time, therefore requiring timely delivery and administration to patient. Due to the limited time window for administration, these drugs are often produced as single-patient doses. Learn more The future of radioligand therapy One of the fascinating aspects of radioligand therapy is the potential to combine different kinds of radioactive atoms, and targeting molecules, into different combinations unique for a particular type of tumor. At Novartis, we are experimenting with these interchangeable building blocks with the aim of developing new radioligand therapies to potentially treat a broad range of cancers.

Learn More Bringing gene therapy into focus Dr. Botond Roska says we should keep our eyes on gene therapy. Learn More Novartis gene therapy R&D currently focuses on AAV-based therapies and CRISPR-based technologies   AAV-Based CRISPR-based AAV (adeno-associated virus)-based therapies have the power to deliver new or working copies of a missing or nonworking gene to human cells. As AAV seems not to be associated with any disease, it is considered a safe and attractive vector for gene delivery. Novartis is exploring the use of AAV-based therapies across neurology and ophthalmology by delivering new genes into patient cells. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based technologies create double-stranded breaks in DNA, acting like a pair of molecular scissors that can be used to insert, remove, or replace specific pieces of a person’s existing DNA. Novartis is conducting early research on the use of CRISPR-based technologies across hematology and ophthalmology to potentially treat diseases by correcting genetic defects.

CAR-T cell therapy is currently one of Novartis' key focus areas for research and development Individualized CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy uses a patient’s own immune system to fight certain types of cancers. A patient’s T-cells are extracted and reprogrammed outside of the body to recognize and fight cancer cells and other cells expressing a particular antigen.

Cancer is a formidable enemy that uses molecular tricks to evade drugs and the human immune systems. Efforts to fight it are advancing rapidly, and more patients are living longer with cancer than ever before. But cancer death rates are still too high, particularly for patients with advanced malignancies. Breast cancer cells. Credit Christophe Antczak. The oncology team is developing a robust portfolio of treatments that destroy tumors selectively and strip away their defenses. They include: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies: CAR-T cell therapies train T-cells from the patient's own immune system to attack and kill tumors. Targeted Radioligand (RLT) therapies: RLT therapies attach radioactive isotopes to proteins that home in on cancer cell targets with high precision, thereby sparing healthy tissues. Novel small molecules: We are developing novel small molecules against targets that were previously considered undruggable. Our researchers leverage fundamental knowledge of cancer biology and bring new chemistry to bear on the most difficult therapeutic challenges. For instance, Novartis researchers discovered a new immunotherapy target called TIM-3 that could bring new hope for patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. And we are developing a treatment that blocks tumor-promoting inflammation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Importantly, our work is not limited to pioneering discoveries in the laboratory. We also collaborate and test hypotheses in early-phase clinical trials, so we learn directly from patients.

Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are responsible for nearly 18 million deaths worldwide each year and represent a huge burden for individuals and society. Our cardiovascular and metabolic disease researchers are developing a diverse portfolio of approaches to prevent, slow, or reverse these conditions. Super-resolution microscopy of cardiomyocytes. Credit Frederique Black. Led by Shaun Coughlin, the team uses every tool at its disposal to better understand the root causes of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, discover and develop drugs against relevant targets, and better identify patients by prognosis and mechanism to provide them with maximum benefit at minimum risk. Our priorities include: Atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis causes most heart attacks, strokes and peripheral arterial disease and remains the single leading cause of morbidity and premature mortality. Our portfolio and pipeline focus on therapies to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decrease inflammation, key drivers of the formation of plaques in the arteries. Strategies to reverse atherosclerosis are also under exploration. Heart failure: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is an increasingly prevalent disorder in which the pumping chamber becomes stiff and unable to function normally. We seek to understand the mechanisms driving this form of heart failure and develop novel therapies. We continue to develop next generation therapies to treat or prevent heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Atrial fibrillation: We seek to develop safer antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain normal sinus rhythm and to understand the root cause of atrial fibrillation to ultimately prevent it. Obesity-driven disease: Obesity is epidemic and drives type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and a host of other diseases. We seek therapies that can deliver substantial and durable weight loss to reverse and prevent obesity-driven diseases. "Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality and Novartis is committed to addressing this unmet need," says Coughlin. "With the tremendous tools and technologies available, there is a great opportunity to change medicine and impact public health.” Reimagine medicine with Novartis Learn about opportunities to join our team Related Links Musculoskeletal disease research at Novartis Immunology disease research at Novartis DAx: exploratory disease research at Novartis Research Disease Areas Share Print Save Novartis Navigate Novartis Patients and Caregivers Healthcare Professionals Researchers Job Seekers Journalists Investors Partners Suppliers Topics Clinical Trials ESG SpeakUp Explore Stories Diseases Locations Products Novartis Pipeline Novartis companies Sandoz Advanced Accelerator Applications Gyroscope Therapeutics Footer Bottom © 2023 Novartis AG Terms of Use Privacy Contacts Cookie settings Site Map Web Accessibility Open Source Novartis Site Directory This site is intended for a global audienceSkip to main content Search Global | en Menu Home Research & Development Research Disease Areas Immunology disease research at Novartis Immunology disease research at Novartis Discovery of medicines to improve the lives of the many patients suffering from immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Our immune defense is essential for protecting us against dangerous pathogens. But in millions of people, the same defenses switch allegiance and mistakenly attack healthy tissue and organs, causing debilitating and sometimes lethal illness. Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are treated often with broadly immune-suppressing steroids that are only partially effective, can have troubling side effects, and increase the risk for infection. The Immunology disease group is developing transformative therapies, including small molecules and biotherapeutics, that target the root cause of these diseases by modulating the immune system to restore health.

Led by Christian Bruns, a group of more than 200 scientists collaborates with clinical researchers and uses cutting-edge analytical and computational tools and technologies to probe molecular disease pathways in tissue samples from affected patients. This approach allows us to stratify individuals based on treatment response and identify dysregulated immune pathways and novel molecular targets in disease pathology. Our researchers have pioneered groundbreaking treatments for multiple sclerosis, organ transplantation, arthritis and inflammatory skin diseases as well as rare genetic diseases. The group's research focuses on these priority areas: Immune tolerance: Our goal is to develop therapies able to restore immunological tolerance to the body's own tissues while preserving protective immunity against harmful pathogens. If successful, this approach could potentially lead to cures for patients with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Type 1 diabetes. Immuno-dermatology: Our mission is to increase the molecular understanding of autoimmune and inflammatory skin diseases to enable the discovery of innovative therapies. Our research focuses on atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, inflammatory acne, psoriasis and vitiligo. Immune regulation: We are focusing on immune sensing pathways in innate and adaptive immunity that mediate chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatologic autoinflammatory conditions. Immuno-nephrology: Our mission is to discover innovative treatments for patients with acute and chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease and transplantation. Inflammasome: Our goal is to establish a leading portfolio of inflammasome inhibitors. The inflammasome is a key signaling node of the innate immune system. Our research addresses different aspects of inflammasome activation aiming at effective and differentiated new therapies. In an advanced project, our scientists are developing a monoclonal antibody targeting CD40, a cell surface receptor of pivotal importance in the regulation of immune response. In the context of kidney and liver transplantation, the anti-CD40 treatment has the potential to provide a therapeutic breakthrough: organ transplants that last a lifetime. "Our ultimate goal is to develop transformative therapies resulting in cure," Bruns says. "That's a very high ambition, but we have access to state-of-the-art technologies, and a high level of expertise and experience both within our group and among our external collaborators that's allowing us to come up with novel innovative and transformative options for patients."

Vision loss is widespread and becoming more common as the population ages. Approximately 253 million people worldwide suffer from visual impairments, including 39 million who are blind. Ophthalmology researchers at Novartis are developing a diverse portfolio of compounds – small molecules, biologics and gene-based treatments – that protect and restore vision. Mouse retina, courtesy of Novartis Brand Lab. Led by Cynthia Grosskreutz, the team includes clinicians and scientists whose guiding principle is to fulfill unmet medical needs for patients who lack effective treatments. By drawing on specialties such as immunology and advanced analytics, and probing the fundamental biology of vision loss, we can develop interventions that enable patients to see at their fullest potential. Our researchers are studying how eye diseases progress over time and how patients manage their vision. This allows us to target the root causes of eye disease with treatment regimens that patients are more likely to follow. Some of our priorities include: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD): Our scientific focus is primarily on the dry form of AMD for which there is no treatment. We are also interested in developing ways to improve the effectiveness of current approaches to the treatment of wet AMD. Glaucoma: Patients with glaucoma lose specialized cells in the retina – called ganglion cells – that transmit visual information to the brain. Our ophthalmology team is investigating why these cells die and how to protect them. Ocular surface disease: (Dry eye syndrome.) We are moving beyond treatments that provide short-term relief with novel therapies that target the underlying biology of what patients experience with this condition. Novartis researchers are also studying ways to treat inherited retinal disorders with gene therapy. These blinding conditions affect light-sensing photoreceptor cells in the retina and cause progressive vision loss over time. They can result from any one of over 250 different gene mutations identified so far. Our aim is to suppress a patient's own defective gene or replace it with a functional copy to achieve lasting therapeutic benefits. "This is an incredibly exciting time for ophthalmology," Grosskreutz says. "We've seen dramatic advances over the last 20 years. In addition to our diverse approach to understanding the biology of vision, we’re also taking a patient-centric approach to the science of making new medicines that could address unmet medical needs."

Neurologic diseases place a heavy physical, emotional, and economic burden on patients and their families. We believe that we can make new treatments that will modify the course of disease and dramatically improve patient lives. A super-resolution microscopy image of astrocytes in a brain organoid. Credit Max Salick Neuroscience research at Novartis is focused on three research pillars: Neurodevelopment – New genetic insights and therapeutic approaches are becoming available to inform drug discovery for diseases or disorders that stem from abnormal development in the early stages of life. This informs our neurodevelopmental portfolio, which is focused on neuromuscular diseases, intellectual disabilities, and epileptic encephalopathies. Neuropsychiatry – We are investigating the genetic drivers and brain circuitry underlying psychiatric conditions to better understand how the brain functions in adulthood, after development, to develop potential therapies for neuropsychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation – We want to better understand how the brain resists injury and ages healthfully over the lifespan to better understand neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation – two interconnected processes that contribute to disease in the aging brain. Several new pathways and biomarkers have emerged in recent years that are shaping medicines we are developing for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, progression in MS and rare monogenic neurodegenerative diseases. To guide our drug discovery and research efforts, we focus on human data and use technologies to develop models of disease that are more predictive of clinical benefit in patients. For instance, we use cells from patients, convert them into various cell types in the brain or let them develop into miniature brain-like organoids. In parallel, we also have the capacity to manipulate neural circuits using optogenetics - the use of light to control the activity of single neurons. We are also developing gene therapies to address genetic conditions, especially diseases caused by the mutation of a single gene. Gene therapy works by replacing or repairing a missing or defective gene to restore normal functional protein, thereby addressing the root cause of the disease. “The wide range of modalities now available to create therapeutics for neurological diseases, coupled with our improved understanding of disease biology and ability to do clinical trials, suggests that we’re at an inflection point in our field,” says Bob Baloh, Head of Neuroscience at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.

Musculoskeletal diseases negatively impact the quality of life of hundreds of millions of people globally. These diseases cause pain and discomfort, limiting the range of movement and activities of people living with these conditions. The mission of our Musculoskeletal Disease (MSD) research team is to restore mobility and independence to patients with some of the most intractable of these debilitating conditions.

(Image modified and adapted for the web by Fidelis Onwubueke.) Our research focuses on finding innovative therapies for three musculoskeletal disease areas, for which there are currently no effective drug treatments: Osteoarthritis Tendinopathy Devastating neuromuscular diseases Novartis pursues pioneering research in MSD – a field that has traditionally seen limited progress in development of effective therapies. We have made bold commitments to musculoskeletal discovery research in order to address this historically difficult terrain. We pursue novel regenerative approaches for osteoarthritis and tendinopathy and unique treatments for specific neuromuscular diseases. Our researchers are unraveling the complex biology of these diseases – identifying targets and interrogating biological systems suspected of playing a role in disease. Additionally, we’re exploring novel clinical endpoints, such as biomarker discovery and the development of digital tools to assess mobility and new, translational imaging approaches. For example, we’re working with colleagues to use advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to see molecular changes deep inside the knee to assess the effectiveness of therapeutics to regenerate cartilage. Progress in such uncharted territory demands an openness to new approaches and space for iteration. The team is committed to discovering new therapeutic modalities, from small molecules to biologics and gene therapies, to treat patients. The flexibility required to be successful in this endeavor is reflected in our multi-disciplinary approach: our team includes cell and developmental biologists, data scientists, bioengineers, neuroscientists and drug hunters. “We are committed to tackle the vast unmet medical need in musculoskeletal disease and bring novel therapeutic options to patients. This takes an appetite and dedication to high-risk exploration and we must be agnostic about how we get to a new medicine, whether by serendipity or design, molecule or biologic,” says Michaela Kneissel, Global Head of the Musculoskeletal Disease Area (MSD) at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research.

Led by Tewis Bouwmeester, the group deploys cutting-edge tools such as CRISPR, organ-on-a-chip and organoid models, genetics and computational methods to probe disease pathways, and devises strategies for restoring the normal functioning of cells and tissues. Many of our researchers have backgrounds in pathway biology, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Together with disease experts, experienced drug hunters and clinical experts, our basic scientists work to identify areas of high unmet medical need and discover potential novel drug candidates for further evaluation. We advance towards new frontiers in drug discovery with a focus on two therapeutic area priorities and one multi-organ approach: Kidney disease: We are using three-dimensional organoids and other tissue models to identify drugs that reverse autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This genetic disorder often progresses to end-stage renal disease, which currently can only be treated with dialysis or transplantation. Liver disease: Our researchers are evaluating therapeutic opportunities for patients with acute liver failure and  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and want to promote liver regeneration for other acute and chronic liver conditions. Fibrosis: We are also building a cross-organ research group to tackle the underlying mechanisms of fibrotic diseases. This new endeavor will focus on targets and pathways that are applicable across several systems with the expectation of developing therapeutics that address multiple fibrotic indications. In ongoing research, we measured how vast networks of blood proteins undergo synchronized changes in patients with NASH or various chronic kidney diseases. This blood-based biomarker was developed using proteomics technology and provides a non-invasive tool for assessing disease progression and how patients respond to new drug candidates. "We're always scouting for the next big opportunity," Bouwmeester says. "And in deciding which therapeutic areas to enter we ask: What is the unmet need? What is the current standard of care? Is there scientific reason to believe that we can improve on it in a transformative way? This is our fundamental approach."

To help address this burden, the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD) is discovering novel medicines that treat and, ultimately, contribute to the elimination of these diseases. “Some of these diseases have been around for thousands of years,” says Thierry Diagana, Global Head of NITD. “We now have the opportunity to apply modern drug discovery technologies and find new solutions to this ancient problem. Our vision is to create therapies that can be part of eradication programs for diseases like malaria and human African trypanosomiasis.” As a small-molecule drug discovery research institute within the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), NITD works in collaboration with a number of academic and non-profit partners. NITD research currently focuses on parasitic diseases, such as malaria, cryptosporidiosis, and three major kinetoplastid diseases – human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. “I’m proud to work alongside a team of scientists committed daily to solving a very important problem that affects people who we don’t necessarily see every day,” says Diagana..

Our team of translational medicine researchers work to bridge this gap and ensure that safe, effective and innovative treatments reach patients as quickly as possible. 3-D movies of cartilage reveal structural details, including damaged spaces. Sections shown here are cartilage along the femur, or thigh bone. Image credit: Didier Laurent and Aparna Srikanth Led by Evan Beckman, the group applies its medical and research expertise to guide promising therapeutic candidates along the path to development. Our physician-scientists have a deep understanding of disease biology and unmet medical needs. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with our discovery colleagues, and alongside a dedicated team of preclinical safety, pharmacokinetic, biomarker and clinical scientists, we identify and validate new drug targets, compounds and biological drugs, and provide insights on where novel therapies can achieve the greatest clinical benefits. Before a new therapy is given to people for the first time, scientists in Translational Medicine first rigorously test our drugs in preclinical studies in animal models for safety and pharmacokinetic properties. Many of these scientific experts from Translational Medicine remain with the therapy as it moves into the clinic and into patients throughout the drug development process. Our group also develops biomarkers and assays to investigate whether a given therapy alters the same disease pathways in people as it does in preclinical studies in model organisms. By using imaging data, genetic expression profiles and other powerful tools, we are able to explore treatment responses in far more sophisticated ways than was possible in the past. In that way, we let our science point us towards the best medical applications for a new therapy, instead of committing to just one disease area early on. We evaluate experimental therapies by: Characterizing their properties and performing initial tests to confirm they act on specified targets and are safe for people; Designing and conducting focused studies in small numbers of patients to understand a candidate's therapeutic potential in different diseases; and Identifying the diseases that a therapeutic candidate will likely treat most effectively These small-scale studies are typically carried out in smaller homogeneous populations of patients within a disease and sometimes in rare genetic diseases. The results of this careful initial testing help us streamline future efforts in diseases that may be more widespread. For instance in Osteoarthritis, a highly prevalent disease with 300 Million patients suffering worldwide. Predominantly affecting people over the age of 45, it can also occur in younger patients, especially athletes after trauma or joint injury. Patients suffer from pain, reduced mobility and relevant reduction in quality of life. It has been shown that OA increases the risks for depression and cardiovascular disease, patients experience a loss of independence and have a higher mortality risk. OA poses a substantial burden on affected individuals and an economic burden to health care systems and society. The pathomechanism of the disease is multifactorial and research in recent years has elucidated various factors contributing to the progressive joint destruction. Despite these efforts there are currently no treatments available that modify and change the course of the disease by affecting its underlying cause. Existing medicines only temporarily target pain as main symptom and for some patients, unfortunately, joint replacement surgery is the final option. We have developed a rich pipeline of various compounds that target different anabolic, anti-catabolic and anti-inflammatory aspects of the disease. These small molecules, antibodies and biologic proteins allow for targeted and individualized treatment approaches. In addition, our research focuses on opportunities to improve imaging technologies, diagnostic biomarkers and patient counselling based on disease modelling to speed up development and improve the precision of future osteoarthritis therapies. "We're taking great ideas in early research and finding suitable opportunities to advance them toward the next phases in development," Beckman says. "And in doing that, we're thinking hard about the biology and science of human diseases, while also applying a clinician's judgment to guide our therapies to the places they might have the biggest impact and change the practice of medicine."

We collaborate across scientific and organizational boundaries, with a focus on powerful new technologies that have the potential to help produce therapeutic breakthroughs for patients. Researchers have used the standard tools of biology and chemistry to develop many successful treatments, and we’ll continue to use them. However we recognize that these tools leave many drug targets—key proteins and nucleic acids known to play a role in disease—out of reach. We would like to hit these targets to fight diseases, many of which have dodged the conventional molecules in our arsenal. To address this challenge, we are blazing a new path: organizing our early discovery efforts around a scientific discipline called chemical biology. Chemical biology brings together experts from different fields—including biology, chemistry and computer science—to create new types of molecules and use them to probe biological systems. Our teams are increasingly breaking down barriers between fields to make progress toward tackling difficult targets. For instance, one team includes biochemists, structural biologists and others, all working to invent molecules that will influence the cell’s own system for degrading proteins. The goal is to degrade particular proteins that we can’t hit with conventional molecules. This approach to drug discovery requires researchers to make connections across the company and beyond. Internally, NIBR works in concert with Novartis Global Drug Development (GDD) to prioritize research projects with the greatest potential to impact the lives of patients. Also, we aim to strengthen ties with external collaborators such as academic labs and biotechnology companies generating disruptive tools and technologies that might significantly accelerate our work. To encourage collaboration, we’re recruiting a Faculty of Scholars, inviting some of the brightest minds in academia to work in our labs. We’re making it easier for Novartis teams to share compounds with labs outside the company to help advance science more quickly. And we continue to form strategic alliances when appropriate. In 2016, for example, Novartis signed a deal with Xencor to access bispecific antibodies for immuno-oncology. These antibodies latch onto two targets instead of one to harness and direct the power of the immune system against cancer. Our brand of chemical biology is directed at the discovery of potential therapies, for which NIBR leads research from their conception through the proof of concept in Phase I and II trials. When molecules are ready for testing in humans, our proof-of-concept studies enroll small numbers of patients to make an early assessment of a drug’s safety and effectiveness. Based on results of these early studies in patients, NIBR and GDD colleagues select which drug candidates show enough promise to qualify them for additional testing in further clinical trials.

Through NOA, Novartis pursues a partnership-based approach, sharing the cost of its medicines with government healthcare systems, charities and other payers, or directly with patients without healthcare coverage who are unable to pay for the full cost of their medication. Specifically, the program uses three locally-tailored, patient-centric models: Shared contribution, in which national or provincial governments and other entities share the cost of treatment with Novartis; Co-pay, in which the patient shares the cost of treatment with Novartis; and Full donation of certain products. We believe that through this partnership-based approach, we can extend affordable access to a broader number of patients in a sustainable manner. Today, NOA offers assistance to patients in developing countries in Asia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America.

The application includes all indications covered by the reference medicines Prolia® (denosumab)* and Xgeva® (denosumab)* for treating a variety of conditions, including osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures, treatment-induced bone loss, prevention of skeletal related complications in cancer that has spread to the bone, giant cell tumor of the bone, and treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy.1,2          “In addition to being an important medicine for cancer of the bone, denosumab is critical in the treatment of osteoporosis and potential prevention of osteoporosis-related fractures that so many women over 50 are at risk of,” said Keren Haruvi, President, Sandoz Inc. and Head of North America. “We are proud to be among the first to submit a BLA for a denosumab biosimilar as, if approved, it could increase patient access to an affordable, high-quality, potentially disease-modifying treatment across the US, while also delivering savings for healthcare systems.” In the US alone, more than 10 million adults over age 50 are estimated to have osteoporosis, of whom more than 80% are women.3 It is predicted that one in two of these women and one in four men will have an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetimes.4 Osteoporosis-related fractures may lead to diminished quality of life, disability, and even death.5  The BLA includes a comprehensive analytical and clinical data package, including data from the Phase I/III ROSALIA study. Results confirmed that the proposed biosimilar denosumab matches the reference medicine in terms of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis; and contributes to demonstration of similarity, which is the basis for use in all indications. Sandoz biosimilars help patients, in areas including immunology, oncology, supportive care and endocrinology, access critical and potentially life-changing medicines sustainably and affordably. Sandoz has a leading global portfolio with eight marketed biosimilars and a further 15-plus in various stages of development. About denosumab Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody designed to bind to the RANKL protein, an activator of osteoclasts (cells involved in breaking down bone tissue).1 By binding to and inhibiting RANKL, denosumab decreases the production and activity of osteoclasts, resulting in a reduction of bone loss, and subsequently the likelihood of fractures and other serious bone conditions.6 Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
