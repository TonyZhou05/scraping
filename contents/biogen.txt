Newborns and infants can develop infantile-onset SMA, the most severe form of the disease, which may lead to paralysis and prevent infants from performing the basic functions of life, such as swallowing or holding up their heads. Later-onset SMA is more common among children, teens, and adults, who may experience significant muscle weakness and disability, such as the inability to stand or walk independently. Our Approach Previously, individuals with SMA and their families had no treatment options. This changed in December 2016 when Biogen received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the first therapy to treat SMA. The therapy has since been approved in more than 60 countries and has helped thousands of patients around the world to date. Availability in the European Union will vary by country, per local reimbursement and access pathways. Innovative Research Biogen’s commitment to the SMA community is unwavering, and we continue to advance leading research aimed at addressing unmet needs and improving clinical outcomes for individuals impacted by the disease. Biogen is collaborating with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to identify new therapeutic options — specifically, new antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) candidates. We are also leveraging our learnings in SMA to advance potential therapeutic options and solutions in other neuromuscular indications with high unmet need.

Explore Our Pipeline Modalities With capabilities in multiple drug modalities, including small molecules, protein therapeutics, antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy, Biogen pursues the most appropriate modality for each target. Small Molecules Small molecule therapeutics are often taken orally as a pill and can readily distribute into cells and tissues, which differentiates them from other modalities. Medicinal chemists aim to optimize the potency of starting molecules toward the desired biological target along with physical properties to maximize the potential of the medicine to treat disease. Protein Therapeutics Therapeutic proteins, also referred to as biologics, are often as much as a thousand times the size of small-molecule drugs. Although this type of drug is much more complicated to make and characterize, using biologics allows scientists to attack serious disease in ways that might not be possible with other technologies. Antisense Oligonucleotides Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are synthetic, single-stranded nucleic acids consisting of eight to 50 nucleotides which bind to RNA and are designed to interfere with target gene expression. ASOs utilize several distinct mechanisms to alter RNA and either restore desired protein expression or reduce and modify toxic proteins. Gene Therapy Gene therapies target the root causes of genetic diseases. They expand our potential to treat previously intractable diseases by capitalizing on recent advances in our understanding of human genetics.

We are grateful to the patients, healthy volunteers, families, hospitals and clinics that participate in the clinical trials for testing our potential therapies. Each individual’s participation contributes enormously to our understanding of disease and has the potential to benefit patients around the world. Deciding to participate in a clinical trial requires careful consideration. In most cases, the therapies investigated in clinical trials are not yet approved by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. The benefits and risks of taking investigational drugs are not completely known. By volunteering for a clinical trial, you are helping the medical community determine whether new investigational drugs are safe and effective. About the clinical trial process Biogen is conducting numerous clinical trials in neurologic and immunologic diseases to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential therapies. View our current pipeline to learn more about clinical trials for specific conditions See detailed information on currently enrolling clinical trials for Biogen investigational and marketed therapies on clinicaltrials.gov Biogen Trial Link: Through Biogen Trial Link, we hope to connect patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals with education and information about our clinical trials. Download our Learning about Clinical Trials brochure (also available in Spanish) Access to investigational drugs outside of clinical trials Patients may potentially gain access to an investigational drug or a drug that is not yet approved in their country through our expanded access programs.

Clinical Trials Clinical trials are the main way for patients to access investigational drugs. Biogen’s clinical trials are conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs so that regulatory authorities — such as the FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe — can decide whether or not these drugs can be approved as a treatment for a disease. Biogen strives to design and run clinical trials that will provide these regulatory agencies with the data they need to determine if an investigational drug is beneficial to people.   To participate in a clinical trial, a patient must meet the inclusion/exclusion (eligibility) criteria. These criteria are important because they help researchers identify people who can participate and identify a group of people with similar characteristics of a disease. This makes it easier and quicker for researchers to evaluate the investigational drug, potentially leading to faster review and approval. Learn more What is Early Access? Early access is a potential pathway for patients diagnosed with a serious and/or life-threatening disease or condition to gain access to an investigational product for treatment outside of a clinical trial when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available. In these instances, a patient’s treating physician can request an investigational product prior to regulatory approval, where allowed by local laws. Who is Eligible for Early Access Programs? Biogen considers granting early access to investigational products when all of the following criteria are met: A patient is diagnosed with a serious and/or life-threatening disease or condition and no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy is available to treat the disease or condition. The patient is not eligible to participate in a clinical trial. Sufficient data exists where the potential benefits of the treatment outweigh the potential risks for the disease to be treated. There is adequate supply of the investigational product, and providing the investigational product will not interfere with ongoing clinical trials or the overall development program. Investigational access provided in this setting is allowed per local laws and regulations. Available Early Access Programs SOD1-ALS: Tofersen Alzheimer’s: Aducanumab (outside of the United States only) How to Submit a Request All requests must be submitted by a licensed physician on behalf of the patient. All requests are considered in a fair and just manner in accordance with our guiding principles. However, please understand that submitting a request does not guarantee access will be granted. Tofersen: Email medicineaccess@clinigengroup.com Aducanumab: Email medicineaccess@clinigengroup.com Our Early Access Guiding Principles Biogen is equally committed to enacting early access to products in development for qualifying patients, and communicating with the patient community, healthcare providers (HCPs), and healthcare systems on the timing of such programs. The following principles guide decisions to provide access to our programs: Access for appropriate patient(s) to address high unmet medical need in a safe, ethical, and just manner in compliance with applicable laws and regulation. Access while ensuring the integrity of clinical trials and the development of medicines. Access that does not jeopardize the pathway to broad long-term access and approvals through local health systems. Access that minimizes burden on healthcare systems, HCPs, patients, and families.
